support,as conom. 
support,as nominator.
support,per noms. 
support,per noms. BDD is a strong contributor with thousands of edits and years of experience. I have no problem supporting. 
support,with great pleasure. I work with BDD at the [[WP:GOCE|Guild of Copy Editors]] (where we're both coordinators) and have seen their good work at RM and AfD. A fine addition to the admin corps. 
support,There are plenty of important roles on this project of which content creator is only one of them. BDD has done good work over a number of years. That his primary activity is not content creation is not of concern. 
support,per noms. I don't see a reason not to. 
support,BDD already wields a broom pretty well so why not formalize it? I'm not too concerned about the lack of indepth experience in developing articles because he has contributed so much to the [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Guild of Copy Editors|Guild of Copy Editors]] backlog drives: as his attest he has often been on the leaderboard. We don't all need to take the same route to adminship. My only quibble is a very minor one what's with all the edits to his user talk archives? I hope that he will keep any current discussions involving administration on his main talk page so other editors can find them easily. 
support,barring a completely unexpected answer to proforma question 6 above. The heads up about the old <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:BDD&oldid=16988125 2005 User Page> is a good one; someone that "right on" at age 17 is certainly worthy of support after the better part of a decade of additional seasoning (sporting a clean block log and no indications of assholery over that time unsurprisingly). Concerns about relative lack of content creation are misplaced; administrative functions are only tangential to content writing which is the reason that some of the best writers are not administrators and some of the best administrators do little in the way of mainspace content creation. An excellent candidate. 
support,because I see no good reason not to. 
support,if a qualified editor is asking for the tools to work on [[WP:RM|requested moves]] an area in which hardly any administrator is willing to touch they should be given the tools pretty much by default. 
support,I've done a formal review on him previously and considered nominating him myself but wasn't sure if I could be around to do a fair job of it. I'm very comfortable handing him the extra tools. 
support,From his hard work in copyediting to his kind and helpful personality I fully support this candidate. 
support,Seems to be a good editor. 
support,my father told me you can always trust a W&M grad. In all seriousness I have run into BDD at AfD several times and have long thought he was a solid admin candidate; glad to see he finally ran. Good luck. 
support,Yea I've seen him a lot. Good candidate. 
support,Net positive contributor. 
support,looks good to me. Competent user looking to work in an area that's often short of admins. 
support,No Problem.
support,looks like a great candidate for the mop. 
support,Here since 2004 + no problems = WP:DEAL. Looks solid and trustworthy. Content creation is unrelated to whether he'll use the tools properly but the candidate has numerous DYKs. He's also surely familiar with current resources since any academic librarian who was in high school in 2004 hasn't been in the field too long. 
support,with pleasure. 
support,No concerns. 
support,BDD seems like a good candidate. I also reviewed this editor according to my own and am satisfied. 
support,No worries. From what I've seen is always civil and thoughtful to others and I definitely think we can trust him with the admin tools.[[q:The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (film)#Galadriel|May he be a light in dark places when all other lights go out]].<!(paraphrase)> (Good luck and be good.) ~ 
support,although one would be generally concerned regarding the peak of editing leading up to the 2012 election season upon review of the edits during the months leading up to the 2012 general election in the United States most edits were outside of the realm of politics. The subject of this RfA has become an avid contributor to the community and works with the GoCE (always a good sign IMHO) and has a clean block log record.
support,I can understand opposers who want to see more content work but I don't accept that admins are a "governing class". Or at least we're not supposed to be we're supposed to be a serving class. I know there are some admins who think they're the bosses and I've clashed with one or two of them in my time. But I do think that those who are best at creating content should create content and those who can serve best by protecting and assisting them in that task should become admins (though I would like to see more overlap in the two roles). So when evaluating candidates at RfA my final decision to some extent comes down to whether I think they have a "serving" or a "ruling" mentality and I think BDD fits in the former category quite easily. 
support,I understand the opposers in principle but I think BDD has had content work certainly enough to know how things operate and have a sense of the difficulties content creators have. I'm impressed by BDD from my interactions with them. 
support,no concerns. 
support,looks like a fine editor. 
support,Fully qualified candidate. 
support,Per noms. 
support,Good overall experience and a sound understanding of how the back office functions. I'm not really understanding the opposes so far some of which seem like the typical threadshitting bitterness that plagues the bottom of RfAs these days. BDD has created some admirable articles such as [[Steven Amstrup]] and [[Extra Virginity]]. His talk page interactions seem fine and he seems to have a positive vision for the project. 
support,No concerns.
support,Adept at [[WP:RM|RM]]. Good luck! 
support,As much as I respect Malleus S Marshall and Colonel Warden for their content creation efforts and Jusdafax for his usually sound reasoning I must say that I believe that these four gentlemen are singing a tad offkey in this instance. Like them I like to see wellrounded administrator candidates who have a sound appreciation for editors who create content and have shown some talent for doing so themselves. Wikipedia is after all an encyclopedia and our principal purpose is to create good content; that purpose includes all users including admins. That having been said I think BDD has demonstrated he knows how to write well enough in the English vernacular and how to create an encyclopedia article based on a dozen or more among the 38 articles he has created. Sure I would love to see several Good Articles among his accomplishments but he's also shown that he has a strong command of policy and a head full of good sense. Cheers to you BDD good luck as an admin and never forget why we're all here. 
support,I trust you and think you'll make a great administrator. 
support,I've no concerns will make an excellent addition to the admin corps. 
support,I'm satisfied this candidate has the temperament and experience to wield the mop safely. Some good evidence of dispute resolution on their talk page and archives. 
support,Builders build houses for people to live in. Decorators paint them. Groundwork people prepare sites for builders to build on. Demolition men remove houses that are not sound. Removal men bring the belongings of the people who are going to live in the houses. Legislators make regulations concerning standards of construction and safety. All necessary jobs unless you live in a grass or mud hut area. They don't all need a full knowledge of each other's jobs. I can't see any reason why BDD won't make a good admin. 
support,I somewhat share the concerns of some of the opposers but I probably disagree with them on the solution the answer to a lack of contentcreating admin candidates is to nominate some contentcreating editors for adminship. Opposing the nominations of those with other skills is not the answer. That's like saying "we don't have enough police so I'm going to oppose the hiring of more fire fighters". Nominate your contentcreators; I'll back them too! 
support,per the opposers. The ones who aren't writing articles 24/7 are the ones that should be admins not the other way around. 
support,9 years of experience coordinating the most important of our cleanup projects solid experience in the sort of contentious administrative tasks that most admins prefer to avoid and several DYK articles when weighed against a lack of a GA clearly show that BDD has no clue how Wikipedia works. [[Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory|Wait. Strike that. Reverse it.]] 
support,Content creation is important but the editor has 10 DYKs which is more than enough for me. All told plenty of clue and plenty of experience merits plenty of support for BDD. 
support,Sound candidate. Contributions evidence good judgment. As to the criticism of Q9 response closing such discussions is a skill best learnt on the job. [[WP:DRV]] exists in case of errors. The answers given (if not necessarily perfect) seem to be a sensible starting point for a new admin. 
support,No concerns. 
support,An overall [[WP:NETPOSITIVE|net positive]] for the project. Best of luck to you BDD. 
support,In addition to the points raised by above I support this candidate because of their strong contributions and leadership of the [[WP:GOCE|Guild of Copy Editors]]. I hope the opposing comments motivate the editor to promote articles and create more original content. 
support,Why not? 
support,A few of the AFD votes are questionable for me but overall the candidate seems trustworthy. 
support,No concerns for me. 
support,I don't normally participate in RfAs but in view of the reservations being related to content creation and being a content animal (more or less than those raising reservations) I'd say DYK quality counts for more than quantity of content. There have been admins with less DYK. In any case what is needed is temperament and BDD has that. Look also at who is nominating. 
support,If an editor has 10000 edits to mainspace and someone pops up to suggest that the editor has no content experience that person should be ignored. Other than that this is a thunkhewasalready. 
support,No problems here Mop please!! 
support,based on review. Like others I would like to see more content work over time. 
support,Weak candidate has sufficient content contributions to satisfy my criteria and otherwise seems clueful and mostly sensible. Weak because I'm nervous about handing them the delete button. The idea in their answer to Q9 that because a town becomes uninhabited it loses its notability is troubling especially when they thought that was supported by [[wp:NPLACE]] 
support,My experience with the candidate has been very very good! 
support,I join with several of the editors above in thinking that BDD was already an admin and that speaks I think to BDD's general reasonableness. I don't agree necessarily with some of their AFD !votes but I appreciate that there is a reasoning behind them it's not just "Keep because reasons" or whatever. If the tools are granted in this case I believe we would find ourselves with another thoughtful admin who would not jump headfirst into things and screw them up and we've been lacking that sort of admin recently. I read through the opposes and while I respect my esteemed colleagues under that heading I find them unpersuasive. 
support,With Wikipedia having more than 4 million articles already it's not easy to find a subject for creating a new notable one let alone start a GA or FA from scratch. The certain lack of content creation and his statements/answers above convince me that he would be a rather excellent admin... 
support,I like this candidate's history with Wikipedia. I think this candidate's decisionmaking processes would be appropriate for the project. 
support,I've been aware of the user and their work for some time now and I generally have confidence in their judgement and understanding of Wikipedia. I'm surprised to find from the responses to questions that the user is no older than mid20s as I perceived them to be somewhat more mature than that age implies. I don't like the peculiar answers to Q9 they caused me to reconsider my opinions of the user but I think we can trust the user to have the good sense to be more cautious about closing AFDs than those answers indicated. 
support,User seems solid in their work. Not a major article writer and I would like to see more content work but admins don't do much of that anyway so this is probably a good fit. 
support,per Shadowjams and Nyttend. The candidate is helpful and clueful with just about enough content experience to be trusted with the tools. 
support,I see no reason not to trust the user with the tools. 
support,User was helpful at a recent RfM I started and has a solid edit history; the "content creation" aspect is important certainly but not everyone does content creation and BDD wants to use the tools for work with moves and the like so I don't see a problem. Stalwart111 and Peridon above hit the nail on the head: some people do lots of stuff other people specialize. So what? 
support,Hardworking editor with plenty of clue. Already familiar with behindthescenes janitorial type tasks. About time they had a mop! 
support,On Wikipedia as in the larger world there are creators and there are custodians of that which has been created. Both roles are critical and neither should be dismissed as inferior or unimportant. Of course there are those who flourish in both roles but likely there aren't enough of them to constitute a sufficient pool of RfA candidates. BDD looks to be a highly competent productive editor who would not abuse the tools. 
support,Looks like they will be a helpful productive and trustworthy admin. 
support,A good candidate. Good luck. 
support,As per Shadowjams and Nyttend. Further long term user has 10 DYKs with creating 38 articles.Feel the user can trusted with tools and see no scope for misuse based on track.
support,This is the type of noncontroversial editor needed among admins. 
support,The candidate seems trustworthy and knowledgeable and I don't see any red flags.
support,Candidate seems to be trustworthy knows what's going on has experience working in the background. I don't buy into the contentcreation requirement different editors work in different arenas. 
support,Lots of good experience working in adminrelated areas good communication skills I don't see any problems. 
support,no concerns  
support,Solid work at WP:RM. 
support,Greatly productive and knowledgeable. 
support,I like the look of highly detailed answers to the questions. It makes me think that he will have solid admin skills. 
support,High editcounts and nice answers. 
support,While there may be concerns raised about content creation 10 DYKs still represents a large amount of work especially when content creation is not everyone's forte and it is also more than quite a few of our most respected admins.
support,[[WP:NETPOS]]. Reviewed the candidate eralier and no reason to suppose he can't use the buttons wisely. 
support,looks good to me.
support,it's been such a very long time since I last got to do that. I agree with Malleus and others below knowledge of content creation is important in administrators but I disagree it's important in all administrators. Wikipedia as a project needs a wide variety of different 'types' of administrators it's nice we have some who focus on images others who focus on templates and yet more who try and deal with the vandalism that's so prevalent. WP exists in a state where compromise is essential and no one solution is perfect having content led administrators would be good for many things but not everything so when good candidates come forward who will be a net positive to the project even if they don't have a FA GA DYK and the triple crown I feel we should support them and make use of the skills they offer the community. 
support,Net positive clueful editor. Amory (
support,we could use some help on the nondrama section of the XfD such as [[WP:RFD]]. Oh BTW GA's FA's and other shinies are not required by law although [[Wikipedia:Don't feed the divas|some people think so]]. 
support,with great enthusiasm. I have worked with him on RM and some AFDs in the past and completely respect his approach to the process and believe he already makes a great addition to the nonadministrative work and promoting him with a mop only improves his ability to contribute further. 
support,Saw his sig around; impressed by how clearly he explained his thoughts in discussions. A row of GA FA etc. topicons isn't needed. Trust is. He has mine. 
support,Answers appear generally clueful no reason to think tools will be abused. (And I still haven't done a GA...)
support,I'm not concerned by the supposed 'lack' of content creation and I think we can trust BDD not to abuse the tools. It's no big deal.
support,This person comes across as trustworthy and competent to utilize the administrative tools on Wikipedia. 
support,though I would strongly recommend the candidate be cautious with nonhousekeeping CSD nominations given the lack of experience there and the mistaken tagging of [[Oakwud]] (though the answer to Q10 is encouraging in this regard). Otherwise seems perfectly qualified with no red flags. I think RfA actually has the opposite problem to that identified by some of the opposers: a lot of editors now expect candidates to have "content creation" which isn't defined as contributing to articles or even writing articles but as something closer to writing GAs and FAs. The skills required to do this have basically nothing to do with the vast majority of administrative work.
support,opposes offer a few extremely minor red flags but not enough to believe that this editor will abuse the tools or position.
support,I thought they were already an admin but that's because I confused their name with Seriously though I think they're plenty qualified. ~
support,great user with a good record of content creation as well.
support,Moved from oppose. See below. 
support,While I lend a great deal of weight to several of the opposes below specifically Hobit and DGG's I find them as a majority to be unconvincing. The candidate is unlikely commit any intentional asshattery that is going to break the encyclopedia. That works for me. 
support,BDD has been a good RM closer and gives the appearance of being a thoughtful person. Giving him the opportunity to expand into other administrative areas of the project will I believe benefit the project. 
support,There are a few valid rationales in the oppose section which has degenerated into the typical example of why suitable candidates are reluctant to run for admiship but my research plus instinct confirm that this candidate is mature and can be trusted not to abuse the tools. 
support,A great contributor with a ton of experience and a clean track record that speaks for itself.
support,"Trust" seem to not be in question. Sufficient content work. Admin Help at WP:RM is needed. Please be cautious with speedy deletions. 
support,per Dirtlawyer1. Nobody is an allrounder and I have no problems with admins focussing on (or mainly working in) specific areas. 
support,I don't see the lack of extensive content creation experience as a major factor for an editor who primarily wants to help with a RM backlog. <sub style="border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;">
support,per clean block log and no indication of troublesome behavior that would suggest abusing these tools. Have come across him in AfDs and found him easy to communicate with. Content creation would be nice but I do not find it a requirement. If there are issues regarding adding and removing content that requires admin involvement I hope he will seek additional input in such matters. It's just not a reason to oppose him being able to use the tools. 
support,no major concerns; I actually thought you already were one! 
support,Per pretty much everyone else. In response to the opposition over lack of a GA I'd say that his dozen or so DYKs are probably equivalent in work to at least one GA. 
support,I've tried to take the oppose arguments very seriously and I have thought about them carefully before landing here. It seems to me that the concerns are about what could happen: bad decisions due to lack of detailed content work bad decisions about deletion discussions. However I just don't see anything to make me believe that these things will actually be problems if the candidate becomes an administrator. I see plenty of evidence that the candidate listens thoughtfully to feedback and is ready to selfcorrect and I see enough experience with content. I also note that the long history of the user account began when the candidate was still quite young so I'm more interested in today than in long ago. 
support,The encounters I've had with BDD have always left me with a feeling that the editor was a competent and greatly useful contributor. I have no worries that he will continue helping to improve Wikipedia with his new tools. I want to note again that I find "lack of content creation" to be a very poor reason to oppose. Wikipedia needs content contributors. Wikipedia needs editors interested in discussions and dispute resolution. Wikipedia needs gnomish editors. Wikipedia needs administrators. Some users are lucky enough to be part of more than one of those categories. Requiring RfA candidates to be contentoriented discussionoriented and maintenanceoriented all at once is really fucking stupid and it's the reason why hardly anybody wants to volunteer for an RfA and even less make it through. Y'all need to [[WP:NBD|chill out]] and let people who want to help [[WP:NETPOS|actually do so]] as long as they're not grievously inexperienced or have shown poor behaviour or judgement. Granted if the process for revoking adminship wasn't so cumbersome perhaps it would help but that's another debate altogether. ·
support,Per noms.
support,Impressed by selfdisclosure and sense of humility. I see a net positive here. This inclusionist has no concerns with thoughtful deletionists. 
support,Without reservation. 
support,No worries. Looks good. 
support,BDD has been very helpful in closing [[WP:RM]] requests and being an admin will be able to help eliminate the backlog there. WP:RM is designed to not have a backlog if enough admins were available to close or relist the requests. 
oppose,No significant content experience therefore no real understanding of how Wikipedia actually works or more often doesn't work. 
oppose,Although I wouldn't put it quite like Malleus I'm becoming increasingly concerned about the ratio of contentcreating sysops to noncontent creating ones. We're in the process of electing a governing class who see content creation as something other people do and although we can appoint these people we can't unappoint them if we turn out to have made a mistake. I don't think you need to write content to understand Wikipedia but I do think you need to write content to achieve a full understanding of the problems and issues facing contentcreators. I would support next time if this candidate could show either (a) evidence of collaborating with others to build a more substantial article or (b) evidence of having written audited content by himself (e.g. a Good Article).
oppose,I was interested in this question of content creation so I looked above where the candidate seems to suggest that he's proud of creating [[ProLife (politician)]]. But on close inspection that article was started by someone else and the candidate just expanded it. Looking at the contributions for last October I notice the creation of [[List of breweries in Idaho]]. This seems quite weak in that none of the entries are bluelinks and the source is quite promotional in tone ("Visit Idaho"). And as the candidate is quite proficient with redirects it's surprising that he didn't go on to create redirects for the distinctive brewery names like [[Laughing Dog Brewery]]. As the candidate is a librarian I would have expected them to do a better job by turning up sources like Beer and Brewing in the Inland Northwest 1850 to 1950 or Great American Craft Beer. My impression is that the candidate still has a lot to learn. 
oppose,After some thought I am with the opposes here and Colonel Warden and S Marshall bring up some specific concerns that have me in agreement with them. Admins should be a bit more wellrounded than the candidate appears to be and since Wikipedia adminship is for life as currently construed six months of seasoning in dedicated content creation would not be a bad thing. 
oppose,I honestly appreciate your detailed answer to my rather annoying question. And I fully realize that answering a hypothetical can be fairly bogus. But the answers scare me a bit. 
oppose,As far as I can tell the ed. still thinks that notability is only valid if it's permanent. The example for an abandoned town illustrates it: there is nothing in NPLACE saying what he thinks. The actual practice is at WP:NGEO " Even abandoned places can remain notable because notability encompasses their entire history. ." It's not a formal guideline because it is almost impossible to establish a notability subguideline due to stubborn objections to anything proposed but it's consistent practice.I'm also concerned at some recent AfD contributions like [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Teddy Turner]] and [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Richmond Research Institute]] where the ed. did not consider the possibility of merging or redirecting.
oppose,Lack of CSD participation as well as content creation make this a no. 
oppose,per Q9 and Hobit. These answers were eccentric. Also per Malleus; RfA candidates should have some content creation under their belt. 
oppose,IMO the candidate seriously lacks editorial judgement ... I agree w/ at [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting conspiracy theories]] the candidate never responded to Shearonink and the supporters who did respond didn't do BDD's position any favors. 
oppose,I'm also concerned about the lack of content creation experience. Mine might class as weak oppose but with no real ability to remove an admin once they're appointed I have to fall into the oppose category. 
oppose,Weak oppose Yesterday I checked out his content contributions to see if the opposing editors had a point. Because he has no notable articles and his 10 Dyk articles are the basis for the counterclaim of his supporters I checked out his latest Dyk. I was welcomed by a vastly oversized portrait which was at first normal and then it was oversized by the candidate <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Duane_Nellis&diff=546980707&oldid=546919161>. Perhaps "normal" is not a good word because the creator of the image (not the candidate) who also removed the salary and a first name in the article seems to be very close to the subject of the article and that should have been investigated by this candidate too. But the fact that he does not know the normal size of images is enough for me to believe he has a lot to learn.
oppose,The main problem is the suspiciously enthusiastic nomination by Cuchullain who has a hobby of making trouble for me. 
oppose,Fruitless oppose The second I mention "lack of content creation" the beuraucrat will move on to the next oppose and completely ignore anything I have to say as past precedent has shown for the past several years. Despite that it is still the reason I'm opposing this candidate and I'll continue to do so with every candidate that can't be bothered to expand articles regardless of what closing bureaucrats and current administrators think. I don't have a "good article" nor do I care to apply for one even though I've made significant contributions but if admins want to consider me a 'snob' for daring to have a dissenting opinion so be it. 
oppose,BDD has been helpful at ANI in my experience perhaps by avoiding vindictive threads. On the other hand we need more focus on improving articles as a community lest the goals of encyclopediawriting continue to be slighted as this site turns into a politicalfront for Google and trainingground for Wikia editors both forprofit enterprises. 
support,Exceeds the qualifications on every point. Look like an excellent candidate:reasonable moderate and focused. Good find by the nom. 
support,Seen him around. He seems more than fine. 
support,Yes CCI is hugely backlogged and needs every hand it can get.
support,as I trust nom. 
support,Best candidate I have seen in a while: Wizardman is trustworthy Bilby has the content experience has his priorities in the right place (e.g. here to build an encyclopedia) and is willing to help in an area where help is desperately needed. Why are we still discussing this? 
support,as nom. 
support,Fully qualified candidate. 
support,Fine candidate working in an important area. Will be able to help out even more with the mop. 
support,excellent candidate. 
support,The copyvios are calling... (Admin tools are required to remove autopatrolled/reviewer from editors who are subject to a CCI). 
support,CCI volunteer who needs the tool kit for that work if nothing else. Sufficient tenure clean block log etc. 
support,no problems here. I thought he was an admin already. 
support,of course! [[User talk:TCN7JM|T]][[Special:Contributions/TCN7JM|C]]
support,About time. 
support,Never came across this user. But supporting because I trust nom. 
support,no concerns. 
support,{{pro}} 
support,Good candidate. NO concerns as per nomination. 
support,Seems reasonable and trustworthy.
support,do not see any problem and wants to work in one of the most understaffed areas.
support,No issues here. 
support,Good 
support,Solid contributor. 
support,An editor who really cares about the content of the encyclopedia and does lots of great work in the very underappreciated area of copyright? Yes please! 
support,100 percent with absolute confidence. 
support,he deserves the tools. 
support,The editor is a good candidate who is willing to help with one of our largest backlogs! A wellrounded contrubutor. 
support,The project will benefit significantly from this grant of tools the editor seems levelheaded and CCI is a thankless important task. In reviewing his contributions outside of his primary areas of interest I saw evidence of [[WP:CLUE]] humility and putting the encyclopedia and consensus first. I have no concerns. 
support,Looks good to me. We need more people who know what they're doing in that area. 
support,Joe Decker said exactly what I was going to say. 
support,A trusted experienced user that won't mess things up. 
support,I've been spot checking Bilby's contributions and the worst thing I found were stylistic errors e.g. "violating" [[MOS:HEAD]] at [[Barry Hannah]] and other articles. If that's the worst thing ... Otherwise I agee with Joe Decker's comments and would add that Bilby seems to defuse drama rather than create it which would be welcome. Actually he just seems genuinely nice.
support,Great work on improving article quality!
support,can't see why not. 
support,This is a very easy one for me. I've worked with Bilby numerous times and I know from direct observation that this is someone with all of the right attributes for the position: intelligent knowledgeable articulate courteous respectful of other editors unlikely to overreach. 
support,Seems like an extremely qualified and well spoken candidate that's willing to help out in an area that needs the help. 
support,My only regret is not being higher on this list. As others have pointed out CCI is perhaps one of the most thankless jobs on Wikipedia. It is both extremely time consuming and under the radar for most editors. As one of the most backlogged areas and even ahead of AFC CCI also requires a tremendous understand of Wikipolicy due to the nuance in every use rationale that can come along. I have no concerns that this editor is light in other administrative areas; I've always supported the fact that we should trust editors with the tools where they need them and to assume good faith that if they venture into other areas they will show the same responsibility they have shown up until this point. 
support,Extremely well qualified candidate. 
support,based on review. 
support,experienced well trusted user with great communication skills who wishes to work in an area crying out for help. 
support,per nom. 
support,per Tryptofish. 
support,A most worthy candidate.
support,I trust your judgement. 
support,I have learnt so much from this candidate about editing on Wikipedia; without their help in steering myself in the right direction through their '[[tough love]]' I probably wouldn't be where I am today. They have an impeccable reputation on the project creating quality in articles and an interest in WP:CCI I'm quite confident that they'll make a wonderful Administrator. Bilby good luck and thank you.
support,Reasoned thoughtful intelligent academic polite. Indications are that Bilby is interested in and supportive of the project as a whole rather than just working in favoured topic areas. Seems spot on. 
support,Adelaide cabal support. Excellent candidate. 
support,No issues. The oppose does not concern me. That [[sheepskin boots]] was a content fork of [[Ugg boots]] is a legitimate reason to favour deletion 
support,You gave a tremendous answer to Q9; answering the first part so completely you answered the second part without an additional word. Believe me I know I have nothing at all to be concerned with in this candidacy.
support,Sure.
support,No issues here. Seems like a good candidate. 
support,There's nothing I can say here that hasn't already been said. Bixby is an excellent candidate who will most assuredly be a superb administrator serve this site to the best of his strong capabilities and truly benefit the project in its entirety. Best of luck to you mate! 
support,I have no concerns that Bilby will be anything but a conscientious helpful and trustworthy admin.
support,Looks like you'll do well. You have my vote. 
support,He seems like a strong contributor and I would be glad to have him as an admin. [[WP:CCI]] is one of the most important things on Wikipedia and I'm glad to have an admin who works so diligently on it. TheOneSean < 
support,per nom. 
support,No red flags good record and a genuine need for the tools. 
support,Great answers to questions (especially #9). This nominee has my total confidence. 
support,I see no reasons why another mop should not be dished out. 
support,Excellent candidate for copyright work and if that's all the opposers can bring up he's more qualified than most. 
support,Well qualified no concerns. 
support,The name sounds familiar. There is no indication that Bilby would misuse or abuse the tools. 
support,admins don't have to be professionals in all levels of possible admin work. I don't have experience with this editor or with CCI in general but it doesn't seem like there would be any problem with tool abuse. 
support,persuaded by his answers his copyright knowledge and experience and his offwiki work. 
support,no concerns about how Bilby will use the tools provided 
support,I collaborated with Bilby on the [[Shrine of Remembrance]] FAR back in 2008 which was a very positive experience and since that time have observed him frequently popping up on my watchlist making thoughtful contributions.Oh and kudos for his analysis of the [[:File:Dissected_frog_cake.jpg|internal workings]] of a [[frog cake]].
support,certainly. 
support,Good day Bruce. 
support,Long overdue imho. 
support,I'm confident that Bilby can be trusted with the mop and would be a net positive. 
support,As per Wizardman and Experienced and has been editing regularly without a break since Jan 2008.Good content work including creating 31 articles and also in [[WP:CCI]].The Project will only gain withe user having tools fully trustworthy.
support,per Wizardman's nomination. 
support,Trustworthy and clueful candidate. I have no reservations. 
support,There's nothing I can add to the supports above really. Great candidate.
support,I'm impressed with Bilby's reasoning on talk pages AfD discussions and in the questions posed above especially number 8 (DGG's; both parts). I'm certain he will make a fine admin. 
support,Well you have Major from me on this one. {{=)}} This is a really promising candidate. 
support,given the great answers to questions 1015 a clean block record and the subject of this RfA is a [[WP:NETPOS|net positive]] to the community I am happy to support giving the subject of this RfA access to the Admin tools.
support,Passes . 
support,Looks like a fine experianced editor. 
support,Appears to be very sensible and knowledgable in the principal proposed area of work and it would be reasonable to expect equally good judgment elsewhere. 
support,Highlyqualified thoughtful candidate who is entirely unlikely to misuse the tools. 
support,Levelheaded calm and experienced. I don't see that the issue raised by the one "oppose" so far is a serious one. Long running disputes have two (or more) sides and I don't see that Bilby has been unreasonable in advocating one side. 
support,I saw him around at [[WP:requested templates]] and he helped very much new / unexperienced editors. 
support,Appears to be qualified competent and trustworthy to be a sysop with the tools. 
support,Suuport No concerns 
support,no issues and plenty of support from editors I trust. 
support,Welcome aboard 
support,Bilby is great! Totally trust him with thy mop. 
support,[[WP:RFX100]] . 
support,I've seen a lot of good work with copyright issues
support,per all the good work they've done in the past the work they intend to do as admin (CCI needs help) and their excellent answer to Q3. ~
support,Why yes of course I'm sure Bilby will be a valuable admin to Wikipedia. 
support,having reviewed answers and a smattering of contributions I see no reason for concern about future use of the bit; I found the tone of the answer to #9 reassuring. 
support,While I recognize warden's oppose below and I am totally in support of his position I find the candidate's answer to Q9 to be adequate. I see no reason to believe that this user will be anything but a netpositive as an admin. 
support,meets most of my although I am concerned about the lack of work at [[WP:AfD]]. 
support,Everything looks good to me and the answers to the questions were all satisfactory. 
support,because I see no reason not to. 
support,Only did a quick vetting since this seems a landslide anyway but didn't find any problems. 
support,As I'm the person referred to by Bilby (as "another local editor" in his response to the first question No. 8 above first paragraph) I have met him personally through several [[Wikipedia:Meetup/Adelaide|Adelaide Meetups]]. I have been very impressed by his knowledge of WP policies and issues and his personal skills experience and willingness to help. This has been especially apparent in his support of my own proposal to help improve the uneven quality of WP articles on South Australian natural and cultural history topics through setting up [[WP:GLAM|GLAM]] collaborations with our local cultural institutions and recruiting their volunteer guides and teaching them the skills to become proficient WP editors. Giving Bilby the admin tools would certainly raise the credibility of this proposal with these institutions. 
support,I thought that Bilby already was an admin... Thanks for nominating! 
support,no concerns with the request. 
support,No concerns. 
support,Excellent candidate. 
support,Fully qualified candidate. 
support,Why not. 
support,Thoughtful measured answers. 
support,Strong Bilby isn't already an admin? Astonishing. I can personally vouch from working closely with him during his time at WMAU that Bilby is thoughtful intelligent and will be even more of an asset to the project with the tools. 
support,Good answers to questions mostly particularly 9 17 and 18. I think the oppose !voters are drawing an incorrect conclusion from the evidence because it does not follow that defending certain edits would automatically lead to misusing admin tools especially when everything else in Bilby's record seems to indicate that he'll be a fair admin.
support,Have been impressed by this editor the few times I have run across him. No doubt he will do a fine job. 
support,I've had a look through your editing history as well as your talk page archives the latter of which indicates you are friendly and approachable. I'm particularly impressed by your experience with copyright investigations and think you'll be helpful in this area as an administrator. Your activity at the Teahouse is also indicative of the fact that you are welcoming of newcomers and willing to collaborate and help those in need. Weighing all this against the opposes below I'm convinced you'll be a [[WP:NETPOSITIVE|net positive]] as a sysop. I'm happy to support. Good luck. 
support,I judged this user based only on their userpage according to the policy . This user meets my expectations and based only on that I support this user's promotion. Others should check other aspects of this user's work. 
support,I took a brief look at the user's contributions and I honestly feel that Bilby will be a net positive as an admin. 
support,Has clue and will use the tools well. 
support,I give full support of this candidate for no reason other than the fact that the only complaint that the !voters can come up with was a single instance of something that happened over two years ago that there is clearly a [[WP:GRUDGE|GRUDGE]] there. That being said this encourages me that Bilby must have a pretty clean track record since that is the best they could come up with. 
support,Outstanding candidate whose activity indicates continued positive contribution to the encyclopedia. 
support,Great responses to questions and a solid edit history. The opposes don't sound too concerning. This editor seems deserving of the trust needed for the admin tools. 
support,no reason to think this user would abuse the tools 
support,Why not? 
support,Looks like a very good candidate to me 
support,No evidence they will abuse the tools or position.
support,and thanks very much for your willingness to work on copyright investigations. 
support,100%. 
support,A great candidate! 
oppose,When I checked his contributions I noticed a particular interest in [[Ugg boots]]. This reminded me of [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sheepskin boots]] in which the candidate seemed to prefer that we address the topic in a proprietary way rather than a generic one. This does not seem sufficiently neutral and so I am concerned that he might use admin tools in a partisan way. It may well be that he is very sensible in other respects but as I am most familiar with that particular incident I'll put the boot in . 
oppose,Bilby seems to be a very fine candidate in most respects. But Warden has highlighted a problem. On the [[Ugg boots trademark disputes]] article there has been a series of Requests For Comment. The first one was closed improperly by an Australian problem editor who has been involved in repeated misconduct. The second one has an obvious meatpuppet case by another Australian editor described <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADpmuk&diff=555224192&oldid=555093685 here> and another possible case that is more subtle and much more damaging to Wikipedia described <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AUgg_boots_trademark_disputes&diff=553967503&oldid=553963004 here> also possibly involving several Australian editors. As I have said on the Talk page it looks good but it smells bad. I think Bilby is a fine editor. He is the best Australian editor involved in that series of articles. But when the trouble started he disappeared. Bilby has done nothing to counsel the problem editors from Australia and improve their behavior. Instead he has become their ally whenever they needed one. Therefore I am concerned that we are giving administrative powers to one side in a content dispute. I am also concerned that the first RFC was closed improperly and the second may be closed improperly in a very similar way. Consensus should be determined by [[WP:CONSENSUS#Determining_consensus]]: "Consensus is determined by the quality of the arguments given on the various sides of an issue as viewed through the lens of Wikipedia policy." The number of votes is not mentioned and should not matter. Also in [[Wikipedia:Closing_discussions]]: "Consensus is not determined by counting heads." But the first RFC was closed by the Australian problem editor by counting votes and ignoring policy arguments. The second time it was closed the administrator admitted that one side had stronger policy arguments but he allowed the larger number of votes on the other side to balance it producing a "no consensus" result. This RFC needs greater participation by experienced editors who will rely on policy not the number of votes. Bilby has voted on the side that has more votes and no policy arguments. Then he disappeared. This raises doubts about how he would use administrative tools if they are given to him. I regret I must oppose this nomination. 
support,as nom. Good luck Darkwind. 
oppose,The nomination statement reads like a load of baloney. There is no clue yet as to exactly what this candidate seeks to do with a trustbased lifetime position and a whole lot more detailed scrutiny on their policy knowledge will be needed to convince me to change this !vote. 
oppose,Baloney describes it very well. Besides 9000 edits since 2005 is not much 10% of it on his own user page only 43 % in article space. Besides slipshod editing and then going through the apologizing routine. An admin (claiming 8 years experience) should be a little more careful. 
oppose,Per Above extremely underwhelming nomination statement poor editing statistics. 
oppose,Immaturity and jumbled prose. 
oppose,per above. 
oppose,I'm sorry to say. While we need a certain number of admins with the expertise to work on the interface they also need to recognize that first the interface is still subject to community consensus same as everything else; and second changes that affect hundreds or thousands of pages require a considerably greater amount of discussion and care than those that do not. [[Template talk:Str sub#Use new lua invoke command to greatly reduce the size/complexity of this template|This exchange from earlier today]] shows a somewhat casual attitude and [[Template talk:Usermulti#Displaying a different username|this earlier one]] somewhat similarly proposes a complex change to a massively used template for a relatively trivial purpose. This user in short makes me nervous. I'd feel better if there were a nomination from one of our current admins who frequently edit complex templates and interface pages. 
oppose,Regretfully Oppose as per Chick Bowen. I would expect a candidate for the mop with the main intention of affecting such technical nature and farreaching consequences to be much more careful with his edits (or in this case his attempted edits). It is a shame as I feel we need more technical editors and more [[WP:WikiGnome|WikiGnomes]] and in the future I hope Banaticus applies when he is a little less bold on such fundamental pages (although [[WP:BOLD]] does have a time and place).
oppose,Per Chick Bowen. I don't feel as if I can trust the candidate with the tools. 
oppose,I want admins with clarity and reserve. I'm not seeing clarity. The Q1/Q3 answers suggest the candidate doesn't know what's important to say here. I'm not seeing reserve. Q5 has an incident where a good faith edit was tagged as vandalism. I'm pleased to see lots of AIV reports but I haven't scanned them. Banaticus isn't seeking the bit to fight vandals but rather scripting. The tone for Q7/citation templates isn't reassuring. I can read the comments a couple ways. I'm happy with neither. Stradivarius's neutral is a good summary. I commend the candidates response but I'm more cautious. I'm worried that fixes will break other things. 
oppose,Reply to Chick Bowen. 
oppose,I think from a personal perspective Bart is a great person to have around. That said I wish he was actually around a bit more. The sporadic editing is disconcerting for me. I'm also in agreement with Chick. I would rather see a consistent editing history before taking the bit and running with it. At this point I don't feel confident that he is ready to take on the role of admin. Respectfully 
oppose,Like Soap said you're clearly a nice guy. What's shaking me up a little is that you identify as an Eventualist. I'd rather see admins react swiftly to more than simply spam or nonsense. Also five and a half thousand edits is a little too low in edit count for someone who has been around since 2005 and like the other opposers your sporadic editing raises a serious question. ö
oppose,per Chick Bowen above. 
oppose,Per all above. 
oppose,discussing that new editors are missing but reverting (good/AGF) edits is a bad idea. (so per Q5) 
oppose,I can't agree with NETPOS or "won't break the wiki" supports when the user is talking about getting involved restructuring one of our most important templates. I have no problem with the sporadic editing mine has been similar and the fact that you return after each busy spell shows dedication to the project 
oppose,Nothing against the candidate but with heavily used templates it would be better to keep the business of doing the coding separate from that of deciding when a change is well enough tested to go live. Opposing on the issues raised by Boing! said Zebedeee (Neutral 7) and Kurtis (Neutral 8). 
oppose,First off I don't think administrators should wait to take necessary action (you mentioned you were an Eventualist) and I don't see a whole ton of activity in AfD or [[WP:UAA]] which are key areas I look for in potential admins. Don't get me wrong you are a great editor but I don't see you necessarily being a great admin. 
oppose,The sporadic editing does not bother me. People have real lives and since Wikipedia is project largely based on writing when inspiration or you take up a focus then the edits can peak. The quality of the edits is also not unfavourable but I find the care and diplomacy in some of the actions a little to be lacking. 
oppose,I really don't know why the user wants to be a admin seems like he was advoiding answering the first couple of questions. Also the user has not been consistent with his edits. 
oppose,Very regretful oppose per Chick Bowen but I might be persuaded to change. It's a 
oppose,per above.
oppose,per Chick Bowen. I also don't like the outcome of the candidate's adoption efforts although that's a relatively minor issue. 
oppose,per Chick Bowen and per his answers to Q5. The candidate doesn't seem anywhere near careful enough to be safe with admin tools. 
oppose,Weak oppose. Many of the opposes above give me cause for concern and neutral !votes 7 and 8 especially do so. I also have the usual concerns about a lack of content creation and the overall professionalism of the nominee in communication. But overall it's what neutral !votes 7 and 8 refer to that cause me to oppose.
oppose,Per {{U|Chick Bowen}}'s rationale. I would hope Banaticus takes aboard these opposing statements as constructive criticism and that they maintain and improve their editing skills. Renominate in a year and I'm sure they will have changed their ways.
support,Resounding support as co nom. Here is someone truly committed to our collective efforts toward building a great encyclopedia. Binksternet comes equipped with plenty of clue and will make us a fine admin. 
support,Generally clueful no reason to think he'll abuse the tools. 
support,When this went live 
support,Per nom. Delighted to be an early supporter. I have seen this editor around and am sure they will use the extra buttons for the good of all. 
support,It's clear (s)he'll be very helpful to WP with the mop. 
support,Trust the nominator; it's nice to see a nominee who is upfront about his past and who has turned things around. 
support,Good luck 
support,experienced user and has great contributions. No concerns at all. 
support,A major content creator. Has done great work. Have worked with him on articles like [[Bomber Mafia]] [[George Kenney]] and [[Bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]]. We don't always agree but he is a pleasure to argue with. 
support,had some help with a matter and was delt with accordingly thanks to Binksternet. Best 
support,Very sensible. 
support,While it is apparent that his passion for WP has resulted in him going a little too far in the past I also feel like he has moved beyond those problems and would use the mop wisely in the future. &#124; 
support,per NuclearWarfare.
support,A valuable Wikipedian with a strong orientation toward content creation. I have often encountered them at AfD and other places and have found them to be helpful and clueful; in fact I assumed they were already an admin. I'm surprised to see so many blocks in their past but I note that all of them seem to arise from excessive passion over content; I don't see any blocks for personal attacks which would concern me more. 
support,Mine is not a reluctant or tentative support but for the record just wanted to provide some basic questions to the candidate (above) to help alleviate any fears or suspicions and as a sort of series of reminders. Fully satisfied that candidate is smart enough not to abuse the tools or the position.
support,I came across Binksternet some time back when working on [[Madonna (entertainer)]] and there's no doubt he shows passion commitment and determination. The answers to the questions show he understands basic policy and how to defuse tricky situations. While I appreciate where the "oppose" !voters are coming from my take on <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Binksternet/Archive20#Final_Warning:_Political_positions_of_Mitt_Romney this situation> is that he straightaway put his hands up and said "Yup I was wrong". That's a good test of character. 
support,A good editor who I believe will use the tools wisely. 
support,I have had interactions with him on several articles. I found him to be knowledgeable and I had no problems working with him; I would agree as one states above he has "passion commitment and determination". 
support,I seem to run across Binksternet rather often. I have seen him reverting vandalism and POVpushing ferreting out sockpuppets engaging in talkpage discussions creating new content contributing to [[WP:DYK|DYK]] removing citations to non[[WP:RS|RS]] sources and communicating with users he's intersected with. In my judgement he understands WP policy and guidelines shows good judgment and is thoughtful in his user communications (one example: <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Salim_Dekkiche&oldid=539846571>). He's also consistently productive (where does he find the time?) which is an asset in a sysop. I believe his record over the last year indicates that he has internalized Wikipedia's rules of engagement and will not repeat the behaviors that led to blocking in the past. I perceive that his work on articles about political topics is motivated by a desire to build and maintain a quality encyclopedia and he is generally effective in doing so. Not all of us have his courage and fortitude to wade into controversial topics about which many people are passionate and about which most of his have opinions that we can't always disguise. IMO the criticisms of his recent work that have been raised in the "Oppose" column should be chalked up to the logic that (1) these articles are minefields and (2) if you walk through minefields often enough sooner or later a mine will explode in your face. People who are brave enough to walk through minefields should not be punished for making an occasional misstep. I believe he can be trusted with the broom and the mop and I predict that he will shoulder a good chunk of the admin workload. 
support,Suppprt I've worked with Binksternet on a number of articles and think that they would make a good admin. The responses to the questions above are excellent and indicate a good understanding of the norms which apply to how the admin tools should be used. 
support,Need more writers and less patrollers. I don't agree with him on some things (seems to endorse the ban the not of the body school of Wiki). That said the guy is flipping smart and a polymath. And we have recently elected some rather weak lumpkins.
support,I think this editor knows Wikipedia and himself well enough to stay clear of using admin powers in any situation where he is involved or strongly opinionated which is the main concern when a valuable editor with strong opinions comes before RfA. 
support,Every experience I've had with this user has been great and memorable. As others have already mentioned Binksternet has a reputation for being experienced knowledgeable thoughtful fair balanced and productive. This is everything one could want in an admin and more. Judging by the quality of the opposes I would say Binksternet is a good choice for moving Wikipedia forward. 
support,though it unfortunately looks like this RfA will struggle to get up. I've seen him around a lot always been pretty impressed by his comments and I actually assumed he was an admin. I was surprised by his block log but it seems to me like he's learned a lot from it and I highly doubt he will ever get in position of being blocked again whether this RfA is successful or not. Looking up through some of the supports as I type I think I'm basically trying to say what Orlady did though I'm obviously not doing as eloquent or thorough a job of it. 
support,I have interacted with Binks in the past. And there have been times we have disagreed leaving me frustrated. But when I went back to review the conversation I came to the conclusion that I'm just a lunkhead at times. Even in the disagreements there will always be something to learn. I don't have to agree with everything Binks says or does but I believe s/he is an asset to the community. S/he is a strong supporter of ensuring neutrality. When articles are in trouble or there is a dispute s/he often jumps in and does a copyedit and cleanup. S/he also spends time sourcing articles to help a troubled article. If something is broken s/he [[WP:SOFIXIT|fixes it]]. I think s/he should be commended for the reform shown over the past what was it? 16 months? I have no concerns that would lead me to opposing at this time. I believe the tools would be used to benefit the project. Thanks for tossing your hat in the ring. Best regards 
support,[[WP:NETPOS|Net positive]]. I've seen the candidate around and have liked what I've seen. I don't expect perfection in an admin and think he has matured enough to be trusted with the mop. 
support,Demonstrating a temperament that is incompatible with being an administrator and then changing his ways and spending sixteen months showing it is a Very Good Thing. It shows selfcontrol (unlikely to misuse the tools) and makes him particularly wellsuited for understanding and dealing with editors who are doing now what he did then. 
support,Strong It would be good to see more of this sort of editor wearing the Admin badge. We need people like Binksternet right now as Wikipedia faces the problems of having an increasing number of editors who have had enough of what they see as a disconnect between the workers and the bosses that wield the power around here. It happens to every corporation as it grows and it has happened here. Binksternet is a passionate man who is willing to stand for what he believes and he is willing to fight for it. He is honest and sincere. But most importantly to me as I consider his "promotion" is the fact that he would not lose sight of the frustrations of what I call the worker bees people like me. I'd also like to add that as a woman myself I have found Binksternet to be a strong supporter of fairness in editing articles that deal with woman's issues and concerns. 
support,I think that Binksternet will be a fine admin he has been in the thick of it and knows right from wrong. He is mature enough to know what is expected of him in the new role and will soon find his niche. 
support,A fine Wikipedian who for a long time now has demonstrated the smarts skills and resilience we need in admins. Condescending slurs in the oppose section e.g. about "temperament" and "personality" only serve to strengthen my support per Binks's answers to the questions and also per Guy Macon Viriditas Orlady MONGO Sarek Nomoskedasticy Jusdafax et al. 
support,Late but strong support by the nominator who would have been first if she hadn't been out sick! 
support,Binksternet is a good user with powers to err (like all human) but a good user. 
support,I'm not worried about your block log. Last block 16 months ago. Some people just don't understand that a block isn't the end of the word everyone makes mistakes. Albeit you repeatedly made the same mistake but you have shown in the past year+ that you have learned. I feel that as an administrator you would be a [[WP:NETPOS|net positive]] to the project. As an admin I would think that you would be more careful not to violate 3RR and/or cause an civility concerns; and if you did you would face appropriate consequences anyway. You seem to be experienced and if you can keep your combatlike attitude (which is okay to have!) in check while acting as an administrator I think you'll be fine. 
support,per NW.
