support,Hooray for wellmannered and articulate editors who just get on with it. 
support,Fully deserves the mop and the flamethrower. 
support,Yes please. 
support,User could make good use of admin privileges. 
support,Good support.
support,per and above comments. [[user:Celestianpower|Cel]][[WP:ESP|e]]
support,good answers to questions sounds like an excellent editor. 
support,in slight sheep mode: good answers to questions I don't know Brian but he seems a reasonable being mop him. 
support,Awesome. Welcome aboard | [[User_talk:Linuxbeak|Talk]] | 
support,been here for a long time and wasn't involved in anything bad. 
support,will make a good admin. 
support,hell just pulling a decent NPOV edit of a flamebait target like [[Microsoft]] gets my vote. 
support,You mean he isn't an admin already? I'm surprised actually. I'd have nominated him myself if I'd known. 
support,and damn the editcountitis. 
support,looks like he'll make good use of admin powers. 
support,The purpose of Wikipedia is to create an encyclopedia and only the main namespace directly serves that end. I agree that it is important for an administrator to demonstrate a wide spectrum of interaction but with over 300 nonmainnamespace it is hard to see how others fear hasn't. We need administrators from all parts of the spectrum of positive interaction not everyone has to be a wikipolitican editing primarily outside of the main namespace. 
support,Weak I say weak as I still don't know him well enough to full on support but from (the very little of) what I've seen he's great :D [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,It's good to see candidates who aren't intentionally combative such as those who gravitate toward policy discussions. 
support,Cool. 
support,Good editor this imbalance stuff is silly
support,He definetely deserves it! 
support,Seems like a reasonable editor and I don't see at all how edit count would be a problem. 
support,Quite positive interactions on [[Browser wars]] (quite some time ago). Clearly not a troll or vandal. 
oppose,Has been here over a year and a half and only has less than 3000 edits. 
oppose,Oppose. 
support,Most edits are very minor and many times doesn't use edit summeries. That said there's nothing particularily wrong and he does enforce and revert unreferenced edits which is good plus Brian voted 
support,Good work noncontroversial. 
support,No question. 
support,&larr;
support,Do we really even need to vote? This one seems so obvious... 
support,An excellent editor who has contributed and created many interesting Jewish historical articles. 
support,Sure. He's done excellent work and has a good even temperment. Shouldn't have trouble as an admin if he wants. 
support,Intelligent and polite will make an excellent admin. 
support,a helpful editor. 
support,Would make a good admin. 
support,Focused on good content polite sensible. 
support,Certainly.

support,No problems here.
support,hope we don't lose a good Africa editor though. 
support,confident he will not abuse admin powers. 
support,I like his work categorizing articles and reverting vandalism. 
support,Backlogs everywhere we need more admins. This one will do fine. 
support,Well deserved.

support,On the whole support but I'd like to see you being <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jose_Cuervo&diff=prev&oldid=27283332 more careful> in the future. That or becoming an alcoholic. 
support,w/ a caveat anyone dedicated enough to work on wiki while in cameroon gets major props. As you've shown a slight bit of "jump the gun"itis this support comes with the caveat that you please google anything before you speedy it. 
support,polite and lots of great edits. 
support,Seems to be a mature experienced editor who wants to help with requested moves and answered the questions very well. 
support,excellent work on Cameroonrelated articles definitely a trusted contributor. 
support,Good edits will use tools well. 
support,Definite support 
support,Great editor more admins watching over Africa articles (and all of wp) won't hurt a bit. I'm sure he'll continue making excellent contibutions too. 
support,Looks good! 
support,Nothing really necessary to add. I think he'd make a great addition to the Admincorps! 
support,per above. 
support,looks like a trustworthy contributor. 
support,Am I too late to make a difference.May the Force be with you! 
support,of course. 
support,Conscientious polite reasonable highly knowledgeable.
support,Will wield the mop well I believe. 
support,Looks like a good user to me

support,Extreme lesbian support and damn the controversy! Brighterorange is very active on AfD. 
support,Orange Furry Alien have seen plenty of edits on my watchlist and in AfD participation should be good admin. 
support,Orange mustache support. One that knowns were to put a semicolon and were to put a comma and willing to spend time fixing these gets my vote. 
support,seen lots of him on [[AfD]]. 
support,see him around quite a bit now a good editor who could make good use of the mop and bucket. 
support,Yes. 
support,Several good contributions in a variety of places. 
support,Extreme <INSERT WITTY COMMENT HERE> support!. 
support,Very active on AFD and other places. 
support,Lesbian support of the most extreme variety! Seen this user around a bit always seems responsible enough. 
support,I have pleasantly encountered this color on several occasions.: 
support,His leadership in the [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Punctuation|Punctuation Project]] is noted and appreciated. 
support,Amazing job in Punctuation project. By the way it's ok for a nonadmin cast a vote here right? 
support,"Yeah Fool. Better recognize Check Yo Self" w/Xtreme Predjudice 
support,Cool. 
support,Yes 
support,No reason to think admin powers will be abused. 
support,It hurts my eyes somehow! 
support,Hasn't been here very long but his talk page implies inoffensive edits and a willingness to learn. 
support,Cool but four months seems a bit short. But still should be okay. 
support,Looks good plus I respect Neutrality who vouches for him. 
support,Agree with MPerel. Neutrality's voucher is good enough for me. 
support,support Because his record indicates a likelihood that he will be a productive and noncontroversial admin who operates in accordance with consensus. 
support,Looks good to me. 
support,Wellbehaved user who works well with others. 
oppose,Being nominated by the guy who hectors voters on one side but not the other for reasons (neutral? ahem) is not an endorsement in my books. Neutrality is not my idea of a positive influence in this community so I can't support his personal friends I'm afraid. 
support,as nominator. 
support,I've come across Brookie before and was favourably impressed.
support,met are! 
support,I'll be honest I've never heard of Brookie before but between his contribs his answers to the questions and the other people who are supporting him I have no problem supporting. 
support,Brookie is a good user deserving of adminship. 
support,good editor. 
support,</sup/><p style="fontfamily: Bradley Hand ITC Comic Sans MS;">
support,Strong Will make a great Administrator and I'm proud to say that he is one of my best friends here in Wikipedia. 
support,I've seen Brookie around; he/she is a good editor. 
support,I liked the answers and the overall behavior of the candidate. 
support,useful eidts in relation to Snowtown South Australia and events associated with that town
support,Fer sure. 
support,Slowly but surely the is becoming the cabal! 
support,As far as I can tell goodhumored and a good editor who could use his own mop. 
support,this experienced and nice editor. 
support,another low profile get on with Wikipedian. 
support,looks good. 
support,Brookie is reliable and consistent in my experience and I think he'll make careful and fair decisions as an admin. 
support,I don't personally know Brookie but seems like an ideal candidate. 
support,No plausible reason not to. 
support,and I still don't get the sig. But who cares you should be an admin! 
support,Very good contributor 
support,and sorry for the b'day mess. ;) 
support,Cool.

support,With due admiration. 
support,Meh. Tepid support. 
support,Bumm13 obviously has a LOT of experience on Wiki. 
support,Quite. 
support,Well duh. 
support,Meets my criteria. 
support,Based on edits and history on Wikipedia there is every reason to believe he will use admin powers wisely and to good effect. Rationales of Oppose voters do not seem to address any issues pertinent to this nomination. 
support,Yupsireebob. 
support,you're not serious. Bumm isn't an admin? Full support. 
support,Yup. 
support,Cool. 
support,Wow! 
support,Good editor good guy. 
support,<nowiki>{{thought he was one already}}</nowiki>. 
support,in lieu of toilet. 
oppose,No way. I don't have any experience dealing with him on Wikipedia itself but my IRC experience in dealing with him suggests to me that he doesn't have a suitable personality for adminship. 
oppose,Hell no.

support,The first time I get to be first! This is a thoughtful editor who definitely wants to improve articles. Don't let the modest cheese reference misleadhe knows his business.

support,this excellent editor. I could oppose but that would just be...sour grapes. HA HA HA I kill me. 
support,A good editor who is well thoughtout and coolheaded with good participation in the various namespaces. 
support,[[Wikipedia:Esperanza|Э]]
support,I've known about Bunchofgrapes since soon after he got here and he's always been a great editor. I like how he really emphasizes [[WP:CITE]] in his work and in my interactions with him he has shown a great degree of [[WP:BOLD|bold]]ness and [[WP:CIVIL|civil]]ity. 
support,I've met up with his activities at several occasions and I am impressed with his demeanor in dealing with awkward situations. After having a look at Bunchofgrapes contributions I am delighted to vote for his promotion. 
support,Yummy ... I mean support. 
support,Sounds good. 
support,I gather that Bunchofgrapes will be pretty levelheaded in working out conflicts.

support,I've encountered this editor in a few places recently and he's consistently been very helpful and amicable. [[User talk:Rspeer|r</span]]>

support,A great editor! Worth interrupting my Wikibreak to support this candidate. 
support,I constantly see this name attached to good work. I am getting sick of it 
support,Have seen lots of good contribs from him! 
support,goes without saying. For all of the above reasons and probably some below as well but wiki is not a crystal ball. [[User_talk:Dlyons493|<FONT COLOR="#DDDD11">Ta</FONT><FONT COLOR="#00FF00">lk</FONT]]> 14:26 16 October 2005 (UTC). This was me wiki seems to log me out randomly.

support,seems to vote on every RFA. 
support,Of Course 
support,Was thinking of nominating him myself. 
support,Yes please! 
support,< I've seen good work etc etc 
support,I haven't had much opportunity to interact but I do remember a survey on which Mr. Weather was a respondent and he was very forthright in admitting that his edit count was insufficient to participate. Despite being unable to vote he showed thoughtfulness in the comments he made. 
support,I see on my watchlist that he does very good work on articles related to Canada's North. 
support,Seen'em like'em. [[User talk:RoyBoy|Boy]] 
support,as has been said above I see this name reverting vandalism all the time.

support,Only suprises me the 3680 article edits but only 118 article talk pages... but in the end who cares. 
support,Speedy support per nom. 
support,Positive contributions to WP. Good egg.

support,Could use a mop.

support,Canderson7 has a good post history and has been hear a good length of time. I also trust the other voters judgement. 
support,I trust the nominator's judgement. 
support,fast and diligent at reverting vandalism. 
support,Have seen the name once or twice and Meelar's nomination counts for a lot. 
support,Returning the favour. 
support,A good RC patroller and I think he'd make a good administrator. [[User_talk:bmicomp|(talk]] 
support,Good RC patrolling and VfD contribution. 
support,I see him all the time catching the vandalism before I do and without the aid of rollback (yet). 
support,Excellent vandalfighter. 
support,I echo a comment above I also often see his reverts of vandalism appear just as I am about to fix it myself. I think he would make a good administrator. 
support,You may label vandals with <nowiki>{{testX}}</nowiki> bit more often. 
support,good contributor. 
support,excellent contributor/patroller. 
support,Nominator supports. 
support,Seems pretty sensible on AfD 
support,Conom support from across the Tasman.

support,ive support. Good editor.~ 
support,CR makes a habit of punishing people who afd hopeless barelycoherent stubs on encyclopedic subjects by turning them into topnotch articles. Cliché though it be I thought for sure someone would have offered him the mop already. 
support,support 
support,per above. 
support,Joining the Crowd He knows his stuff. 
support,of course.
support,per above. 
support,I guess. 
support,As Cryptic mentioned Capitalistroadster is amazing at taking stubs I probably voted delete on and turning them into wellwritten encyclopedic articles. [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,Yes darn it! 
support,Easiest support vote I've ever cast. 
support,see him round a lot. 
support,WP needs more incusionist admins and less POV warriors. 
support,Full support. Great guy to have on afd and elsewhere. 
support,Cool. 
support,we need more levelheaded inclusionists (and I've been accused of being deletionist several times) and he gives inclusionism a good name. 
support,Im sure Ive interacted with this editor...I just cant remember when and under what circumstances. Anyway a notable candidate. 
support,an shining example of a well rounded Wikipedian. Most deserving. 
support,good allrounder 
support,definitely adminworthy 
support,good and trustworthy editor. 
support,He is an editor of principle. When he sees the remedial he fixes it. A true genius of helpfulness and the kind of person who puts his work where his "keep" vote is. 
support,Strong Excellent work on VfD. Often rescues bad articles on notable topics. Very knowledgeable on music and related topics. Wonderful choice for an admin and has complete support. 
support,Holy %#&@!!! He wasn't one already? Inconceivable! 
support,I too am amazed that this excellent editor has not been issued with his official mop and bucket already. 
support,SEARCHING FOR SUPPORT<br>?FILE NOT FOUND ERROR<br>READY. 
support,without any reservations. 
support,I've seen him around and find Capitalistroadster a sensible editor. I like how he often fully explains afd votes and found several of arguments convincing enough to switch my own votes. 
support,I trust that this user will not abuse admin tools. 
support,per MacGyverMagic. I've seen him around a lot on AfD and he knows what he's doing. I'm surprised he's not an admin already!

support,without reservations long overdue. 
support,Looks like this is a done deal but I want pile on very worth while canidate. 
support,Extreme pomosexual support. This is one of those times where I'm like "Wait... he's not an admin?!" 
support,It's about damn time Cap has a calming effect on contentious AfD debates and often saves articles from deletion by doing extensive rewrites. Definitely a trustworthy candidate.[[Wikipedia:Esperanza|a]]
support,Oh yes please. And I second Geogre's Tito's and Cryptic's remarks. 
support,as per nomination. 
support,He should be proud of his contribution to articles put on AfD (answer #2 below). Capitalistroadster has turned countless "deletes" into "keeps" by doing real research and editing. Bravo! 
support,Shoot as a counterrevolutionary then promote posthumously.
support,d nn. Keep after rewrite by Capitalistroadster. 
support,If everyone on AfD were like this I don't think we'd be complaining that it was broken. 
support,strong candidate strong nominators. 
support,waves hand 
support,OMG he's been around for so long and saved so many articles from deletion and he's not an admin??? Impossible! 
support,Keep all schools oops forgot this wasnt AFD. Long overdue support 
support,looks ready to be trusted w/admin tools. 
support,Certainly. 
support,Reheated RfA cliche support!. "I thought he was one already". 
support,Now I can cross this person off my list of "people to nominate". Thank you Sjakkalle. 
support,Good editor good article saver no issues. 
support,support. 
support,strongly. If only all inclusionists worked as hard as he does not just to keep but actually make articles worth keeping. Capitalistroadsterization (or "troadsterization" as I call it) is due to become a recognized term for the turning of complete crap into a fine article. He should try his hand at alchemy. 
support,I have been admiring Capitalistroadster's work at AfD for some time now. Clearheaded and wellreasoned. 
support,Furry Orange Alien Echoing all the above and thanks to the Cap for all the chaff sorting and work put in. 
support,As someone on the other side of the inclusionistdeletionist divide I've always found his votes wellreasoned and exceptionally clearheaded. 
support,Reasonable in AfD discussions does his research and most importantly (as so many have said before) he puts effort into cleaning up borderline articles in AfD. I've changed my vote on more than 1 occasion due to his efforts.
support,duh. 
support,Good work. 
support,so strong it's not even funny. Wouldn't miss this for the world. 
support,Need I say more? 
support,Have I already voted? A quick scan says no but feel freee to remove this vote if I have. [[user:Celestianpower|Cel]][[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,The Marine only votes for the Best! 
support,excellent candidate. 
support,Quite the most peculiarly phrased acceptance that I remember seeing but this surely doesn't matter. 
support,Where's the mop? =P 
support,for the good reasons espoused by Geogre. 
support,excellent editor from what I had seen. 
support,a great Aussie editor who really is deserving of adminship 
support,Strong Suppot I would have voted sooner if I had known he was up for adminship. A most deserving candidate indeed.
support,Great user 
support,Edit history looks good lots of experience with plenty of breadth and depth in the nooks and crannies. History of vandal fighting and courteous on talk pages. 
support,I'm sure your service to Wikipedia would be even better with a mop and bucket. 
support,seen carrp around like what i've seen 
support,yes! 
support,Seems to already do valuable work on VFD. Admin powers will be extremely useful for him in that regard. My limited interaction with him convinced me that he is level headed and discusses potential conflicts before escalating or reverting. 
support,I was thinking about nominating Carrp earlier but the incident with Belizian raised some doubts in my mind. Having raised the issue again here I feel that I should support in order to make clear that the answer below satisfies my concerns. 
support,All the right qualities. 
support,I'll support. 
support,Good experience in dealing with the user. 
support,Good user. 
support,I appreciate the help at VfD/Old. 
support,Seems like a sensible person. 
support,Easy decision. 
support,I wondered where this user came from who seemed to know our ways. Now I know it's Carrp (didn't Carbonite kill Lando the Hutt or something?). 
support,A good egg. 
support,Ohhh you're Carrp! In that case . 
support,Great user in my opinion. ! 
support,Definitely support. 
support,SUPPORT! 
support,Strong Excellent editor strong adminship candidate. 
support,Strong He can be a bit confrentational but I've found him to be friendly. Does an insane amount of work at VfD and is probably the major person making sure the copyright status on images in the featured articles checks out. Also I thought he already was one... 
support,! ! ! 
support,Has strong views on picture use policy (often seen on FAC) which can seem confrontational but which ultimately benefit the project by encouraging people to find acceptable images. . 
support,! more image policing! 
support,Strong Darn I have to use that phrase again: "He's not one already&#8253;&#8253; 
support,Mild mannered support. Too much yelling in here. 
support,[[I thought he already was one|RFA cliche #1]]. 
support,Strong He helped me so I figured i'd return the favor. I look forward to his contributions as an admin. 
support,we need more people willing to take a stand on image use. 
support,He's got his head screwed on. We seldom see eye to eye but I don't think sysops should be an army of chums. 
support,Friendly levelheaded user with strong knowledge of Wikipedia procedures. 
support,does great work in FAC FLC. 
support,VfD record speaks for itself. 
support,How did this fellow get passed over? 
support,obviously. 
support,this fine candidate. 
support,Great editor. 
support,good work. 
support,Very good candidate. 
support,[[I thought he was one already|ITHWOA]]. 
support,Enthusiastic support <crowd cheering>YEAAAAAHHHHH!!!!</crowd cheering> 
support,Always a welcome addition to any debate at VfD where he participates frequently. Although I can understand the POV of some editors that he is confrontational I see it more as straightforwardness. I have yet to see an action on Carnildo's part that I feel is over the line. 
support,he does a good job in keeping me in check at every single FAC I submit. 
oppose,Aggressive and confrontational. My dealings with him have been filled with animosity. 
oppose,too confrontational too power hungry. ( | | 
oppose,I don't mind confrontational editors but I do mind those who make a fetish of deletionism and those who have personal definitions of "vandalism". Given that you are asking to be empowered with the tools to delete articles and block vandals these are important issues. 
support,Absolutely. 
support,I can't see why not. 
support,A good editor who has shown a great commitment to this project. 
support,Technology/math related edits look acceptable there's some admin work too. 
support,Cburnett does quite a bit of work in math articles especially probability related (so not just movies I had once a disagreement with him but he was very curteous during the debate and said in advance he would follow any decision the community will setlle on. 
support,Fair and balanced editor. 
support,A committed editor who shows interest in helping to tackle VfD? Yep! 
support,[[User talk:RoyBoy|Boy]] 
support,Contributed a lot to probability/statistics articles. 
support,As of now I do not see how Cburnett would currently benefit by having access to the admin tools. Currently he seems to not be very active in the janitorial tasks such as VFD CFD TFD and RC patrol. Also this user seems to spend more time in the movie and TV areas instead of working on a wide range of subjects. 
support,Yes of course. 
support,Stongly does incredible work and do check back on article and suggest compromises instead of simply deleting new ideas that is the kind of work that makes Wikipedia what it is. Continue the good work! 
support,Sure. 
support,Hey Cburnett remember your "WTF" comment? It showed me that you are very serious about this project. I think you'll be a good asset for Wiki as an admin. 
support,Meets my admin criterion. 
support,He's a Star Trek fan. Oh and I've seen Cburnett's good work around. 
support,I don't think it's needed at this point but he has my support. Always been reasonable. 
support,What Ben said. If we can't give the mop and bucket to one of the most levelheaded people on this site we shouldn't give it out at all. 
support,True he's a Star Trek fan; but I won't hold that against him. . 
support,I've yet to run across Cburnett's name on an edit and felt that it was a bad edit. Seems to be levelheaded enough to be an admin. 
support,No reason to think admin powers will be abused. 
support,I seem to have a habit of posting at the wrong area. 
support,A calm and very good contributor. Just what we need. 
oppose,Does not meet 
support,Having glanced over Cdc's contributions I have found some reverts of vandalism decent and not overwhelming participation at VFD and lots of good little housekeeping edits. Seems fine I support. 
support,Will support upon user acceptance. Any editor may move my vote to support if CDC accepts the nomination. 
support,Not sure what to make of the lack of comments on CDC's talk page but edit history looks really good with lots of breadth involvement and vandal fighting. 
support,Cool. 
support,Absolutely. 
support,Ahh...so you're the one dealing with all hose Indonesiageostubs! . 
support,Quite a good editor. 
support,Another janitor. Wheee.... I hope you can handle the monster which is [[WP:CP]]. [[WP:VFD/Old]] is an another monster in itself.

support,but please clean up your user page. The WWW is not Microsoft's personal playfield. 
support,Why not? <p style="fontfamily: Comic sans Comic Sans MS monospace;">
support,Very emphatically support. I haven't voted in this forum for a while as recent nominations have tended to names I haven't recognized. I'm pleased to see a name that is not only familiar to me but one for which I have a very high regard. Cedar Guardian has worked hard to remove POV from Lebaneserelated articles and has taken a strong stand against persistent POVvandals. At all times I have found him to be courteous fairminded and evenhanded in his dealings. By the way what he has on his user page is his own business. Give him a break! 
support,OK I support. 
support,CG has an incredible 562 edits in the Wikipedia namespace and 2410 edits overall as of now. It's obvious he's interested in organization and of course his own geographical area of Lebanon. My sample check of his edits show CG to be fair in his editing but just a bit "out of sync" with knowing some of "the cabal." That's fine. . . CG was very nice in responding to from what I saw. And the time CG asked the Help Desk on where to place replies to other editors (CG's space or the other editor's) shows a mark of humility. I judge CG as trustworthy and vote to promote to administrator status. 
oppose,for not amending user page to make it visible to people who don't use Internet Explorer. Wikipedia should be accessible to all. Willing to reconsider if this change is made.

support,SUPPORT. User can admit mistakes and learn from them. 
support,he seems like an excelent user who learns from his mistakes though an admin needs to be bold. Overall a support. 
support,While I would have expected more edits over a year Cesar has done some good work and looks to know what an admin should attempt to do. 
support,Good user. 
support,I've seen him around RC patrol as well as *fD and policy discussions. Good work! 
support,Cool. 
support,I admire this user's abilty to think before he acts and admire the ability of someone to wait a year before making an edit. Just don't take that long to delete nonsense on RC patrol! 
support,I like what I'm seeing here. A good amount of edits is nice but I'm really liking your ability to admit when you're wrong (as you said yourself with the bad faith). Admins must be able to realize that they're human and that they make mistakes. You've got my vote. PS: Use Gentoo! ;) | 
support,he's been very helpful on RC patrol where I have noticed him most; mature and civil attitude. 
support,Very experienced user: excellent contributions in general plenty of janitorial and behindthescenes work. Active against vandals. 
support,Looks like a good bet. 
support,Good and reasonable contributor. 
support,Appears to be a good user who thinks before he acts. 
support,Seems to be clearheaded and capable of admitting his (not dangerously frequent) mistakes.

support,Suppory
support,Just read her talk page and it was pretty impressive how potential conflicts on the Taiwan page were not only averted but the people who had the comments actually complimented Chang after her edits. I don't even need to see the edits that says it all for me the work against the sockpuppets is just icing on the cake. As for not being incredibly involved in the community side of Wiki that's fine. There are alot of specialists on here. As long as Chang contributes she definately deserves the admin job. I apologize in advance if I got the gender pronoun wrong Loren sounds female ...;) 
support,Excellent contributor fast vandal fighter. And oh what a fight it's been recently. 
support,I have seen her edits and have been impressed by her attitude to vandalism. 
support,excellent vandal whacker and does wikifying and external link/category fixing. However there were only 130 Wikipedia namespace edits and she participated very little in VfD processes. But I'll support because I trust Changlc will wisely use the rollback feature and whack vandals with it. 
support,an excellent user I have bumped into on vandal patrol; I expect she will be an excellent admin. 
support,Experienced wikipedianMay the Force be with you! 
support,Could use Adminship. 
support,Mop please... 
support,Neutral I will wait for the process to unfold before casting my vote but I see very little community interaction which is not a plus. Dual fluency is a plus though. 23:42 8 August 2005 (UTC) . 
support,Appears to be a nice guy a great contributor to Australian topics and one familiar with Wikipedia. My only criticism is that he has a tendency to speak in all lowercase letters. I'm not going to oppose on this basis but I would recommend that as an admin he use proper capitalization. 
support,Useful contributions to Australiarelated pages including a focus on sharper categorisation and making the Wikipedia a more effective encyclopaedia. Always polite and willing to help. 
support,Good user and I think it's not that relevant if a user makes a lot of contributions on a narrow topic like Australia rather than spreading the contributions out over a broader range. Categorisation is an important janitorial task and Clarkk has done a lot of that. 
support,After reading the candidate's response to the questions I can see now how he would use his admin abilities to better Wikipedia. He even took the time to create two more questions to respond to some of the constructive criticism we've been giving which I did not expect. Therefore I now support.oo64eva (Alex) (

support,Although I hope you'll be increase your activity here though since that edit count is pretty low for being here over a year. But I still support. 
support,Cnwb is a very dedicated editor and certainly admin material; I've never seen him react badly to anyone. I think above all else the effort he put into proving beyond doubt that the hoax article discussed below was indeed a hoax shows his suitability to be an admin. Furthermore had I known that he was interested I'd have happily nominated him myself. 
support,Contributions look good. . [[Image:Flag of Austria.svg|15px]] 
support,Yep per Ambi. 
support,support quite a lot of very quick research for Davido and very gracious in trying to encourage a couple of bored high school students to become useful contributors despite having caused all that effort. 
support,Good editor 
support,Good contributor who would get great benefit from admin tools

support,a great Aussie editor who is ready to step up. Cheers 
support,per Capitalistroadster. 
support,of course! 
support,good work.
support,Have had good interactions with this user in the past.
support,I have seen him do great work on disambiguation link repair and but for my watchlist I'd have not known of the lengths he had gone to in repairing the links. He uses edit summaries almost always with precise and tothepoint text. An admin status would definitely help him do some of the tasks that he has already been doing in a much faster way and thus improve his productivity. The only complaint I have against him is that he is so humble that he marks most of his edits as minor. He is a trustworthy editor and hence I believe that he would also be an asset to wikipedia as admin. 
support,Ive always seen this editor around. 
support,Disambiguate... er... support. A fine contributor and project leader who I would have gladly nominated myself! 
support,because it's sunrise. 
support,Sun we used to have that once. 
support,Great work! 
support,[[WP:ESP|e]]
support,seems to be a valuable candidate. Good work. 
support,highly valuable candidate. Robywayne's analysis seems to indicate that not only is Commander Keane's dedication to Wikipedia longstanding but it continues to grow. There have been a very high amount of edits on some recent days. Good job! 
support,Okay I know the "ITHAWO" comment is thrown around a lotbut I really did think the Commander was one. He has always been helpful and courteous in our exchanges. He is a pleasure to work with and he definitely deserves the key to the janitors' closet.: 
support,The commander has been very active on the Disambiguation project. He seems to have the knack of being able to disagree with somebody without being unpleasant or impolite; an important skill for somebody who is to be entrusted with the mop. 
support,even though Commander Keen is better. 
support,And why not eh? Seen him around a lot (bloody ubiquitous he is) seems like a good bloke. 
support,wow break out the clichés I was sure he was...

support,Happy to support. 
support,Although I'd prefer the standard questions were answered the information Dan has provided below is the sort of thing I like to know. His response to the Neutral votes below is a good example of his responding to criticism and I'm confident that he will explain any actions of his he is asked to.

I also like that he set up a talk archive since those can be valuable.

I have no hesitation about the user's personality but merely wish to see more time pass and more context established. 
oppose,per Geogre. 
oppose,two months is a little too raw. He hasn't faced a serious dispute as yet. I'd be more happy if he could gain some more experience here and garner some barnstars. 
support,Of course. 
support,as I did for the original nomination.
support,Give this guy the big red hat! 
support,This should be no big deal. 
support,Of course. 
support,works hard does a lot of work that I also do. Obvious Wikiholic and has a lot of edits for one day. He'll make an excellent admin. 
support,Thought he was one. 
support,no problemo. 
support,experienced Wikipedian.
support,without reservation. 
support,Very productive sheesh over 14000 edits. 
support,About time! 
support,Well experienced user. 
support,Sure from the beginning of my association with wikipedia (24th March 2005) I found Darwinek active at several places at the same time. 
support,Looks a good bet and Grutness is trustworthy in such matters. 
support,Strong 
support,Seems that Darwinek has met conditions that lost him adminship months ago. 
support,Seems reasonable. 
support,May the Force be with you! 
support,A tremendous work ethic will be well suited for the job.
support,Has done good work in the 1911 Encyclopedia Britanica project. 
support,The only name of the current nominations I recognize from my CSD cat monitoring. Darwinek's wellreasoned speedy tags indicate a desire to help keep Wikipedia wellscrubbed thus deserving of the keys to the mop and bucket. 
support,Active on RC patrol adding wellreasoned speedy tags. Active cleaning up and maintaining the categorisation. 
oppose,while the number of edits on categories is _huge_ during last months there is no activity on VfD or CfD no reverting vandals and practically no talking to other users. Admins are supposed to deal with various kind of people regularly. 
support,Low edit count but plenty of article edits and has been around long enough. 
support,this is my kind of candidate 
support,because dave souza has answered the questions. 
support,The low edit count in the Wikipedia namespace worries me slightly though. 
support,Darwinek supports [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]related articles editor. 
support,believe he would not misuse admin powers. 
support,it is good to see a nominee without an inflated editcount for a change. 
support,I'm basically voting to counteract the oppose below. Adminship is about wearing a hat. It is a fundamentally different activity from editing. One should support or oppose an admin not based on "does this potential admin hold opinions that differ from mine" but "will this admin abuse his extra buttons or use them responsibly?" I see nothing to indicate that will abuse admin powers. If the test for becoming an admin morphs into a vote on editorial position then we are shooting ourselves in the foot and losing a lot of potentially excellent admins. 
support,like him. 
oppose,too few edits in article space for someone who's been here well over a year and too few edits in Wikipedia space period. 
support,looks good to me. 
support,Sure why not? 
support,per nominator. The times I've seen him around logical and professional. 
support,Belated Nominator Naturally.

support,Goodnatured fellow who even changed his username to make others happy. A consensusbuilder makes a good admin. 
support,Life should be fair. 
support,have had many interactions with Lifeisunfair almopst all positive. i am suprise he wasn't already an admin. I think objections based on his former usernae are absurd and i support him under either name or both. 
support,Not to be confused with [[David Levy (Israeli politician)|David Levy]]. 
support,I even awarded him the illustrious [[:Image:Barnstar_Barnstar.png | Barnstar Barnstar]]. 
oppose,Strongly oppose was one of the most active supporters of ignoring the devs on the metatemplates issue. 
oppose,David has made improvements in his social skills but I still think that he's got the wrong idea about certain policies is still too quick to revert changes without investigating or followingup enough and uses edit summaries to converse/argue. Sorry but maybe a couple more months may help me change my mind. 
support,"$user isn't an admin already?" 
support,Good janitors make good admins. 
support,<Insert cliche of choice here>. ;) 
support,He has keeping the VFD page updated since the change that I added over.

support,Completely support excellent choice for admin. 
support,Cool.

support,sure looks good.

support,Full looking good for ya. 
support,I think the plural is pheoxen! 
support,for great justice! 
support,Good vandal sniper. Decent sense of what is and is not appropriate for articles dealing with literature. Obviously careful about his edit summaries. I like his comments and his manner of dealing with people when I have viewed his edits in previous months. Nothing really negative strikes me about Deathphoenix and he seems like the sort of person who will use admin tools for the greater good. 
support,A good user. 
support,Seen him before. Give him the mop and bucket! :D 
support,he's done pretty much everything I think a potential admin should do (and none of the things they shouldn't do). 
support,Strong I though I introduced Evil and Death though... Reasonably sure... [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,Good and responsible contributor. 
support,Very good editor who will make a good admin.

support,Would have been a good admin months ago. 
support,unlikely to abuse the admin toolbox. 
support,no objections.
support,Got great satisfaction out of the success of working with him at [[Layla]] (a featured article largely due to his work) and feel he can only get better as a user when given a mop. I wish I'd gotten around to doing the nom myself!

support,Keep. Notable verifiable extensively sourced and <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Whatlinkshere/User:Demi widely linked to>.

support,Sigh. RFA cliche #1. Maybe it's because you look like . I should know better than to make assumptions by now. 
support,As one of the people who has previously offered to nominate him of course I support.

support,very helpful user extra points for the selfnom. 
support,Good contributor. 
support,Experienced user with strong contrib's. 
support,Absobloodylutely support. 
support,Undelete this article was improperly speedied clearly asserts notability and is identified as one of the essential subjects of Wikipedia by the [[WP:1.0]] team. Huh? Oh shoot this is RfA... same reasons: clearly notable as I see him often in Wikipedia and has been identified as an essentially good editor by everyone above and me. 
support,passes the lightning admin test and sometimes helps out resolving disputes (my 2 criteria). 
support,this user is unlikely to abuse admin tools. 
support,It's great to see someone wait a bit and then ask when the toolset is actually useful. 
support,Per above I think Demi would make a good admin; also a bit shocked you're not one. 
support,People like Demi make me wonder if we should have a [[WP:CSD]]esque speedying for noms he absolutely deserves it he's helped me several times after asking on IRC. And oh yeah his helpfulness that i've seen waives of the negative aspect of selfnoms here. 
support,fine answers to the stock questions good edit history perfect candidate. ➨ [[User_talk:Redvers|❝]]

support,Denelson seems to have modified his behavior since the last RfA. Go Denelson83! [[User_talk:bmicomp|(talk]] 
support,Dedicated user. 
support,Good User I think 3rd time is going to be the charm 
support,Seen him around using good judgment and being reasonable. 
support,What is in the past is in the past. Good luck Denelson. 
support,IMHO a valuable contributor. 
support,[[Soup|]] 
support,Has recognized and worked hard to address past mistakes. 
support,as per last time. 
support,Strongest Possible He definately knows his stuff and despite what he went through which would have soured many people on the project he grew from it. I'm proud to be a fellow [[Asperger's Syndrome|"Aspergian"]] and I'm sorry I got beaten to the punch in the nomination process. 
support,Has stuck around despite the criticism from before has learnt from it and made changes as a result of it. More admins should do that and adding a knowledgeable experienced user to the sysop list can only be a good thing. 
support,per Splash. I opposed on his previous RfAs but he's gone out of his way to improve and seems like he has gotten much better at handling criticism. Most people would have run away from such objections but he's still here and has improved. I think we need to reward him for that by making him an admin; he's earned it! 
support,Sup Port. I was neutral last time since it was still too close to a RFC but Denelson has kept his nose clean since and I see no reason not to support. 
support,well done on sticking around and working on dialogue. 
support,Though I opposed previously user seemed very interested in improvement and has since done so. 
support,byegones be byegones. 
support,I could have sworn he already was an op he definately has the experience and the attitude to be one. 
support,After the RfC incident months ago he has shown an unbending commitment to being civil with other editors instead of just becoming bitter and argumentative like many other editors would do. 
support,Extreme Autistic Spectrum ! Having Asperger's too (but being less lucky than you my temper is getting me on the wrong side of Wikipedia right now) I know what it's like. Denelson83 is a pretty good guy. He has his flaws but so do I (and I have them much worse I'll admit it). Nobody's perfect. Overall Denelson rocks! :D>< 
support,That's hot. 
support,Yup 
support,After you gave me your vote I went and looked at your credentials and everything looks good to me. 
support,We all make mistakes from time to time but after reviewing the recent history of this editor I am convinced this person would make a fine sysop. 
oppose,Opposed Friday's RfA because the user was once "uncivil" and therefore says Denelson83 can never have a clean reputation. Needs to learn more about Wikiquette how it is applied and how to judge others. 
oppose,per Andre. 
oppose,Weak oppose. There were quite a number of objections on his second RFA that had not been addressed then and I see no evidence that they have been addressed now. 
oppose,quite strongly. Denelson while wellintentioned is immature prickly and quick to anger. His behavior on IRC is a consistent source of irritation and does not demonstrate that he has fully addressed the issues of his RFC. 
support,of course. 
support,Good chap. 
support,I've seen him a lot and I've always been impressed. And (of course) are met too. 
support,great work on AfD. 
support,Clearthinking thorough and level headed. Well involved in the behindthescenes stuff ranging from policy discussions to all the other stuff. 
support,I'd explain all the reasons but then this page would take forever to load. (by the way I got editconflicted three times while trying to cast this vote surely a good sign! ;) 
support,great editor. 
support,solid editor. | [[User Talk:Lomn|Talk]] / 
support,Strong good editor. 
support,for all the reasons stated above 
support,Obvious support. David is the archetype of a good WP admin: very wellinformed helpful responsible and while he holds some strong opinions on policy matters—and will usually leave you in no doubt what he thinks about an issue!—is very reasonable and open to discussion. That AubreyMaturin venture incidentally is quite an impressive bit of mergism <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=AubreyMaturin_series&diff=19107052&oldid=18818887> (<http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=AubreyMaturin_series&diff=prev&oldid=18818887 originial>). Denying him adminship would be something like denying Dirac a Nobel.
support,</sup/><p style="fontfamily: Bradley Hand ITC Comic Sans MS;">
support,as per all. 
support,Regularly see DES about the place should make a good admin. 
support,Good Editor normally see him alot 
support,Yup. A good one. 
support,I honestly thought he was already an admin. 
support,What?! I hereby command everyone to go out and find one person that should have been an admin a long time ago and nominate them just like DES should have been. 
support,Extremely strong support. He's done things all over the place from the Manual of Style RC Patrol the deletion processes and is very active on all namespaces. I can't say I didn't know he wasn't admin but I thought a long time ago that he should be given the mop and the flamethrower. Besides if supports him (even after DES admitted himself that he's butted heads against him) isn't that a good sign? 
support,as I was left with a positive impression of the editor after we had a discussion regarding the changing of a guideline. He was quite calm and made an effort to address all concerns which is good enough in my book. 
support,Another fine user that I have seen all over the place 
support,Very fine contributor. 
support,Absolute support. In addition to all the reasons above he's a regular at the [[Wikipedia:Reference desk|Reference desk]] where he obviously takes the time to give helpful answers to users' questions. What more could you ask for in an admin? 
support,unquestioningly and without the slightest hint of the mere thought of speculating otherwise. There are no reasons not to support and he meets my standards (which are publicised in the apropriate place but I'm feeling too lazy to link to at the moment). To summarise he will be a fine admin I'm sure. (oh and don't worry about the wordiness thing ). 
support,a sensible type. 
support,Cool. 
support,although I am against voting during an ongoing Rfa I thought I had already voiced my support here so I will before it closes. [[Special:Contributions/Who|&infin;]]
support,I've seen him around and he's a good editor. 
support,(trusting that you will have taken note of the concerns expressed below) 
support,Neutral Enthusiam is good but those speedies might be a little over the top. ok on review I think those speedies were good after all sorry about that. And your commitment to tag and bag is laudable even if it is perhaps a bit overly time consuming. 
support,Neutral. Edit history looks good but of course speedied articles don't show up there. The potential for overuse of the speedy tag to become over use of the delete button has me a bit spooked. I might be willing to support if say editor would only actually delete things tagged by others. 
support,JYolkowski is a Wikipedian whose judgment I respect but I'm satisfied with DESiegel's promise not to delete things unless they've been tagged by someone else. 
support,Neutral. What the hell... . I believe DES is going to do a good job even if we do seem to be on opposite sides of policy interpretation more often than not. Just keep in mind when in doubt send to AFD.Extended discussion moved to comments. 
support,in protest at "I don't agree with you on deletion issues therefore I shall vote against you for adminship regardless of any other issues" votes. 
support,I just saw DES elsewhere arguing against deletionist tendencies so any idea that he'd be too aggressive with deletion powers is unfounded. Any such idea is further unfounded when you consider that he clearly repeats at every turn that he believes in not just deleting articles on his own and would instead tag them for someone else to delete and delete articles that other people have tagged. How can you argue against someone who so clearly respects consensus as a principle in policymaking? Looking at WP:RFA today I was somewhat suprised to see he was currently going through RFA because I would have assumed he was already. 
oppose,I've seen him tag a lot of things as speedies that aren't valid speedy candidates so I'm not confident I would trust him with a delete button. 
oppose,His deletionist tendencies tend to run ahead of his research on some topics. He recently put an article I was working on ([[William Rees]]) up for deletion while I was working on it the day it was first postedthis despite the fact that I listed my sources and placed abundant notes as to what I was doing. There were links in the article which if he had researched them would have provided abundant information to convince just about anyone capable of [[NPOV]] of the need for an article on Rees. It is not as if I am some anon IP or something he could have taken the time to check out some of the articles I have created. It is demotivating for a serious editor to have someone do this sort of thing. He needs to slow down and do his homework otherwise he could easily abuse admin "powers." He is not ready for admin responsibilities IMO. 
support,Long overdue I've found him helpful in the past and he could do his cleanup work better with the admin extra buttons. 
support,Cooperative user who has done hard work in Transwiki but has broader experience.
support,It doesn't get any hotter than this. 
support,Give this guy adminship already 
support,Very active doing cleanup and janitorial work. 
support,Supoort yes indeed. 
support,great work on transwikis and other janitor tasks and could make good use of admin tools
support,goes around doing lots of good stuff and doing it well. Plenty of time spent in the areas of WP that admins are needed in most. Admin tools in his hands will speed along the improvment of Wiki wonderfully. 
support,Excellent janitor. 
support,Only had good experiences so far
support,He's a very good janitor gives useful (though short) edit summaries has done nice work with Transwiki and has shown good interactions with other users. He's not an admin? Let's fix that! 
support,why not. 
support,Most definitely top notch editor. 
support,Yep! Dedicated to making WP better. &middot; 
support,I thought he was one already. 
support,All together now I thought he was one already! 
support,Cool. 
support,definitely applies here! 
support,on the condition that the nominee teaches me the mythical secrets of the transwiki process. 
support,excellent member of the wikicommunity. 
support,shows good judgment & clear dedication to Wikipedia. 
support,Looks like a great contributor. Sorry it took so long to get you nominated. 
support,Great work showing good judgement. 
support,Shows good judement and does great work on wikipedia 
support,Baaaa... 
support,Dmc? You didn't tell me you were up for an adminship. Shame on you. Shaaaaaaaaaaaaaaame. 
support,Strong Everywhere I turn these days I seem to find Doc doing great work. He has also dealt with long and protracted debates such as that over [[Authentic Matthew]] with admirable restraint and good judgement. 
support,as nominator. Somehow my earlier support vote did not stick. 
support,I normally see him alot in VFD/AFD and I thought he was a administrador already 
support,a very fine Wikipedian knowledgeable patient firm on facts steers a middle course between perspectives. 
support,Thorough patient and with a pleasant sense of humour he'll make a fine admin.

support,Furry Alien based on what I've seen from this editor about the place (many times) will make good admin. 
support,Interactions with this user have been positive. 
support,helped me out with a query in AfD with speed and precision. 
support,edit history looks impressive. 
support,Anyone who drops you a (sincere) thankyou note for reverting their work when they're wrong has the temperment to be a fair and diplomatic admin. 
support,For sure. 
support,even though Dragonfly is absolutely disorganized (yeah i'm one to talk LOL) 
support,Strong I've seen quite a lot of good work from this user. 
support,He would be a ‘nicely perfect’ administrator. 
support,Hes got a fair if heavy hand and a sharp mind what more cfould you ask for?
support,Reasonable and knowledgeable. (And frankly if disorganization is a disqualification for adminship I ought to be desysopped on the spot!) 
support,That's hot.

support,from college freshman. 
support,Good stuff. 
support,Could you help me close AFDs and clear out [[CAT:CSD]]? Sometimes there is a backlog. Thanks. 
support,a clearly unnecessary vote but just to express my views. 
support,Contributions and answers below indicate thoughtfulness and a broad range of interests. 
support,Just noticed his RFA or would have acted sooner =) But he's pretty knowlegable and an all around nice guy (at least on IRC). Glad to support. 
support,No probs with this nomination. 
support,I would welcome his cool head on my team any day. 
support,only recently came into contact with this user however he appears to be a level headed user who contributes quite a bit to the wiki as a whole. 
support,Woohoo! I'm 50! He's always on IRC and has seemed very adminlike from on there. I look forward to working with him. 
oppose,Oppose. As Alkivar says seems disorganizedlook at the replies to the standard questions for another example. 
support,Seems like a good candidate. 
support,An actively helpful guy allaround. Great candidate! 
support,I haven't had much to do with DF but anyone who fixed the page/section doubling bug deserves every reward the community can bestow. I realise that this doesn't necessarily qualify him for admin (maybe for developer) but he's clearly an example of a very good egg.
support,Definitely. 
support,(by which I mean support) anyone who fixed the page duplication bug in Wikipedia should be sainted not just made an admin for all to jeer at 
support,Seen lots of great work and level headed discussions. [[Special:Contributions/Who|&infin;]]
support,by all means. 
support,Every edit I've seen has been well reasoned. This is one of those that I wish I had nominated. Maybe that means I should spend more time looking for good admin candidates. 
support,DF has made some great contributions to Wikipedia. 
support,support. 
support,a huge number of Wikipedia namespace edits and seems experienced. He also has many valuable article contributions. 
support,and pleased to be a conominator even if in absentia (back from hols now). 
oppose,I am somewhat concerned that the 4 coproposers all come from the far (but not completely extreme) end of one single religiopolitical POV. If there was someone from the opposing POV coproposing my view may change. ( | | 
support,and nominate 
support,Bob was really good in answering my question on optics in RD about a year back. (I'm sure he'll have forgotten my question) 
support,unlikely to abuse admin tools. 
support,we could do with a few Bobs. 
support,looks experienced and reasonable. 
support,Dr. Mellish if you get a chance can you please have a look at [[Photonics]]? Thank you. 
support,Strong delete admincruft. 
support,does good work in optics articles. 
support,Quality intelligent edits. Good coverage across name spaces and uses summaries. Helping out at the help desks is a big help! 
support,2001?!? Good heavens he's a sure bet. 
support,and fight time/edit countitis. ( 
support,[[WP:ESP|e]]
support,2001? 1900 edits? Surely I'd oppose but I guess I've changed haven't I? . 
support,if he is not a safe bet I have no idea who is. 
support,Quality editor can't see him abusing admin functions. 
support,Why not?
support,please increase your interuser communication levels. Other than that you look good. 
support,maybe few edits considering his four years here but they're significant edits like creating whole articles like [[Cauchy's equation]] and [[Lyot filter]] and [[Filter (optics)]]. 
support,Very trustworthy; adminship should be no big deal. 
support,Not everyone should have Wikiobsessivecompulsive disorder. It's nice to see a sane person nominated. Should make a fine admin. 
support,shows sufficient commitment to the project. 
support,When a guy had made nearly two thousand edits but very little user interaction that doesn't tell me that he's a bad editor it tells me that he's a good enough editor that nobody gets in raging arguments with him. I think that's decidedly mopworthy. And I'm not much of an editcount man anyway so as per everybody above as well. 
support,Content is the reason most people come to WP. 
support,Less interaction=less conflict
support,belated thought I'd voted on this already. 
support,Need more admins. This one will do fine. 
support,:: DrBob is doing a valuable job here but admin. powers are not needed for him to continue in his sterling work but they seem to be given on request now so why not. He has to be better than some of the others and his edits are at least sensible and useful. 
support,Excellent editor who surely will use the tools wisely. 
support,Adminship should be easy to get. But only if they are just as easy to get rid off if they can't handle the temptation of power. It looks like DrBob is very unlikely to come up for deadminship in the future after a solid history.
oppose,not enough communal interaction. 
oppose,I agree. In four years he's made only 128 posts to article talk and 55 to user talk which means he's barely interacted with other editors. Also an overall 1944 edits spread out over such a long period doesn't show much of an interest in Wikipedia. 
oppose,What SlimVirgin said. Low communication levels don't show an inclination to adminship or its tasks. 
support,As the nominator of course! 
support,seems like a good candidate over 1400 edits in main namespace and over 700 in Wikipedia namespace. 
support,A dedicated RCpatroller. Someone who even bothers to emulate the standard rollback edit summary by hand (or by script?) deserves to get access to the real thing ;) 
support,seems to have a good eye with regards to maintaining quality. 
support,Great RC patroller. 
support,I was fooled into thinking that Drini is already an admin by the fact that he reverts vandalism with an edit summary as produced by the admin rollback tool. By the way Drini is one of the post prolific contributors to <http://planetmath.org PlanetMath>. 
support,Drini seems to be all over the place doing RC patrol. 
support,Nice work with the new n templates. 
support,I actually thought Drini was an admin for the reason Oleg stated. Great vandal fighter. 
support,[[Image:Symbol support vote.png|15px]] . One of the good guys. 
support,</sup/><p style="fontfamily: Bradley Hand ITC Comic Sans MS;">
support,His contributions to tackling vandalism are stellar and he is experienced with over 3500+ edits. I hope adminship does not interfere with your gallant battle with vandals! 
support,had me fooled too. 
support,OMFG ! 
support,<math>\times \infty</math>! 
support,I really am gonna have to read [[WP:LA]] because I keep seeing people at RfA I thought were admins! [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,I have been working with Drini over at [[WP:PNT]] for a while now and have built a very positive impression of him. I am sure that he will make good use of sysop rights. However please remeber that I am still the adminincharge at PNT even after you are promoted. ;) 
support,4000+ edits since february 2005 comments 99.9% of it. This guy is a vandal slayer. Quality contributions and obviously an intelligent person. He deserves the extra buttons. 
support,Good user 
support,Really did think you were one! 
support,Full per R Lee E; also shared Oleg and Jaxl's confusion because of <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3AContributions&offset=0&limit=100&target=Drini&namespace=0 these> (helpful) edit summaries.
support,Drini is a firstrate vandalhunter. 
support,no explanation needed as the record speaks for itself. 
support,All of my dealings with Drini have been positive. 
support,Noticed his good handling of vandalism when he was still a newbie and am happy to support now. 
support,BTW not to steal Drini's thunder or anything but the edit summaries are from using "godmode light" a script by which emulates the rollback function for nonadmins and which I highly recommend. 
support,Per everybody else. 
support,I've noticed Drini's work and value the input he makes. 
support,I thought he was an admin already because of his rollback edit summarieshe shouldn't be making those because they're misleading but nevertheless he seems to do enough vandalfighting that he ought to have a real rollback button. 
support,I've only seen good things from this guy/gal. 
support,ITHWO GHTM! 
support,truly excellent candidate and gives me an opportunity to use the cliché (it sure looked like he has the rollback tool!). Superb contributor and vandalfighter. 
support,Strong I keep bumping into Drini's edits all the time: a very trustworthy and responsible user... 
support,No big deal. 
support,Yup. Post Drini at the Wiki gates with the required weaponry. Them vandal varmints won't be crossin' us agin! 
support,Like FireFox I keep bumping in to Drini's edits all the time. 
support,absolutely. 
support,I see Drini RC'ing all the time; he'll make good use of the TurboMop! 
support,Oh yes. 
support,of course. 
support,unreservedly! 
support,vandals should beware! 
support,Annoying as Drini almost always zaps vandals faster than me. 
support,very responsible and professional editor. 
support,Extreme lesbian support! 
support,not that he needs to know this (or indeed my vote) he meets . 
support,! Of course. [[User_talk:bmicomp|(talk]]

support,(Could someone please explain how the hell the "lesbian" meme got started?) Does good work.~ 
support,And yeah what's up with the "extreme lesbian support" votes of recent? A lot of users seem to be using that mantra now. 
support,good user. 
support,mmm... thought Durin was one. 
support,BTW i hate pedophiles. 
support,should make a good admin. 
support,good RC patroller and the answers given below are very thorough. 
support,Extreme fake lesbian intended to stimulate heterosexual males support! I just wanted to say that somewhere. 
support,A solid editor and a vigilant copyvio hunter. 
support,I thought he already.. you know. 
support,I think we all know Durin knows what makes a good editor and what makes a good admin. In fact he knows it in more quantifiable detail than anyone else. if only for making me daydream for a couple of days about making some kind of machinelearning algorithm to predict which RFAs will pass and which will fail. even more for talking about the importance of edit summaries. 
support,see below. | [[User talk:Flcelloguy|A note? ]]</font color>| 
support,good work with the RfA graphs me likey them. 
support,Very strong contributor. I especially love his graphs. I think he will make a fine admin judging by his work on RC. 
support,Absolutely. 
support,An asset to the community and an extraordinary person. 
support,Another good pick by Redwolf24. [[User Talk:Acetic Acid|Ac]][[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]][[User Talk:Acetic Acid|tic]][[Special:Random|']]
support,Yep. I would support a candidate like this 92% of the time; 99% over the last 30 days. 
support,And here goes my edit number 6400 to Durin: for Durin’s contributions as also assertion on the user page “I am neither a [[Meta:Association_of_Deletionist_Wikipedians|deletionist]] nor an [[M:Inclusionism|inclusionist]]”. 
support,Everything that I've seen of Durin around Wikipedia is excellent. 
support,Extreme Atheist ! Meets my standards. You'll do well with the mop and bucket. 
support,Good to see him on RC patrol. He gets the job done. 
support,I've crossed his path while doing RC patrol too. Always efficient and accurate. Definite Admin material.: 
support,Extreme male lesbian support (I'm male and I like women). Durin has shown a willingness to take on maintenance tasks. 
support,Good choice. Good luck! 
support,Sup No reason to do otherwise. 
support,[[Image:Symbol support vote.svg|15px]] Extreme Phroziac support! (

support,Sounds good.

support,no problem supporting though it's tempting to start a conflict over the [[Bambara Empire]] just to spite the user's comment below... 
support,Total support It should've been automatic! Indeed El C is confirming it! Dvyost one of the most active editors (if not the most) in all what relates to Africa and many other topics. After a long time waiting for help in [[Gnawa]] he came for rescue [[Talk:Gnawa]]! Congras mate! 
support,does good work.
support,great contributor. 
support,a very good user with just the right attitude. I can't help being a little worried though that the admin tools might carry Dvyost away from providing Wikipedia with excellent and muchneeded articles. 
support,has shown focus as a contributor and helped expand Wikipedia's coverage. I have ran into him several times on DYK. He radiates warmth even through his edit summaries. I hope that his past performance as a contributor is a good indicator of his future performance as an admin. 
support,and much love 
support,per above. 
support,Looks to be an outstanding contributor
support,I'm deeply surprised this person isn't an admin already. 
support,per nom. 
support,low editsummary use is really not a factor in this case since he clearly has the experience.

support,Definitely 
support,[[WP:ESP|e]]
support,per nom.

support,Good user absolutely ready for adminship. 
support,Sure Edward does good work and has more than enough experience. 
support,I'm convinced looks like another 'should have been one long ago'. 
support,Valuable contributer. 
support,of course 
support,Seems sensible and dedicated enough and shows a sense of humour when dealing with difficult editors 
support,Cool. 
oppose,Doesn't strike me as having good judgment. Either he directed his personal (non/rarelyediting) friends ( and ) to this vote not knowing about the common procedure of us not counting them or is employing [[Wikipedia:Sock puppets|sock puppets]] himself. 
support,Me the nominator of course. 
support,Edwin was the one who turned me on to Wikipedia and showed me the ropes. I think he would also make an excellent admin. 
support,The wait is over!

support,your edit history looks good.

support,I find the <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&target=Phase1 spamming> of talk pages in an attempt to solicit opposition to be in rather poor taste. 22:06 21 December 2005 (UTC) . 
support,per above. 
support,Strong I agree see below nominee looks great to me.
support,Clearly understands adminship duties (I like his responses to the questions below). Edits are substantive and show good work ethic. &#126;
support,Everything looks good here and thanks for answering the additional question below. 
support,good candidate 
support,didn't need to wait that long! 
support,good contributor — 
support,has shown commitment and unlikely to abuse admin powers. 
support,Good contributor. 
support,A good contributor who certainly has enough experience now. 
support,I noticed this RfA due to asking users to reconsider their support. I went to investigate; while I can't seem to find the belligerent comments or lack of Wikipedia understanding I am impressed with his calm discussion and have come across Edwin's work numerous times before. I am pleased to support his candidacy. 
oppose,Edwin accused me of copyright violation on [[December 17]] [[2005]] (when his adminship must have seemed in the bag). His belligerent reaction to my explanation for this uploading of an image of former South African president [[P.W. Botha]] see [[User_talk:Phase1]] Copyright violation and [[Talk:Pieter_Willem_Botha]] leads me to fear that he is likely to abuse his newfound powers. 15:13 20 December 2005 (UTC) In another somewhat idiosyncratic judgment Edwin has advocated on December 18 moving the [[Pieter Willem Botha]] article to PW Botha and thus seems unaware of the workings of the wiki "redirect" system.
oppose,per Phase1 
support,Extreme "Yes! I stole the nominator's place" support. 12000 edits 2.5 years experience. WHOAA!!May the Force be with you!

support,SHAZAAM To quote your user page: "My dropinthesea contribution to Wikipedia..." You should also get an award for modesty! 
support,as per nominator. ;) 
support,because in the answer to question 2 the word geoccordinates has two c's in it. 
support,Good project work and I suppose we could use another vandal fighter. BTW how do people get edit summary percents?
support,And thanks for your diligence in cleaning up after Rktect. 
support,we need more admins like him
support,per everyone else. 
support,seems to make sense like that and no sense otherwise. No negative issues as far as I see. 
support,though he hardly needs another vote. 
support,overdue. 
support,ExtremeIAmNotOriginalInMyVoting 
support,per nom. 
support,yes a sure support. 
support,Weak though I still think we need more admins who do things other that reverting watchlist vandalism. Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by 
support,sounds good. 
support,this person obviously does a lot more than just reverting vandalism so I don't know where Kookykman (unsigned above) is coming from. 
support,if the watchlist is 'busy' (has all the heavily hit articles) I have no problem if they did stick to just their watchlist. 
support,Looks like a good contributor loads of experience no issues. 
support,of course 
support,Oh I was missing this one. Great guy patient diligent. I coulnd't not support ( 
support,An excellent candidate and very well deserved 
support,Admirable in dealing with 
support,Calm evenhanded thoughtful how could I not support? 
support,El C is one of our most knowledgeable editors: funny smart reasonable and civil always willing to listen to the other side of an argument. He'll make a great admin. 
support,A very good evenhanded editor.
support,Suuport. Good and experienced user. 
support,In terms of ideology El C and I aren't on the same page but I have the highest respect for his personal integrity. 
support,Yes with pleasure. 
support,I see knowledgeable editor with stamina to clean up topics after POV pushers. 
support,I only all admins had his committment to integrity. String support. 
support,Full support. 
support,he might be a [[Commie]] who likes Che however I'll overlook it 
support,iViva la revolution!Comrade!
support,We need more admins who are willing to ask "Quis custodiet?"; 
support,Cool. 
support,Reasonable thoughtful and humorous though I believe his cat is doing all the editing. 
support,Competent and contributive editor so support. 
support,Calm and knowledgeable editor. Though his views tend to significantly differ from my own resulting in disgreements over article content his responses are always thoughtful. In my view will make good use of admin powers. 
support,Shows evidence of community involvement restraint and a willingness to talk out problems. Good sense of humor too. No reason to oppose. 
support,A goodhumoured contributor and worthy of the mop and bucket. His cat will keep him in line. 
support,Solid genuine contributor. I've been impressed by his work. 
support,Strongly He is incredibly knowledgeable wideranging and often deep exactly the kind of contributor we want. Just as important I have seen him bend over backwards to avoid POV editwars and to work well with others. I know that there are some who do not like his "point of view." I can't say I have followed all of his edits but anything I have been involved in including a number where he and I disagreed he always had facts to support his position while always taking my views (and evidence) seriously. 
support,I'm impressed by his edits and he seems to stay cool. (I comment below on an exception.) 
support,Strong 
support,I was very glad to have his help in a certain longrunning dispute that I strayed into; that and his cautious stance on hierarchy greatly commends his nomination to me. 
support,I am impressed by the support of good editors who have views significantly different from his. That says a lot. 
support,wholeheartedly. All my dealings with him have proven to me not only his erudition and dedication to Wikipedia but also his reasonableness and willingness to work to solve disputes. 
support,Very knowledgable and keeps his cool despite working in areas of Wikipedia that are more like jungles. An excellent choice of admin. 
support,Opinionatedwhich is good. Listens and responds to the oppositionwhich is very good. Cool and waits even when he does not get his waywhich is very very good. 
oppose,[[Wikipedia talk:Requests for adminship/El C|See Talk page]].
oppose,Surely you jest. 
oppose,Decent enough user good edits but a bit too much of a POV pusher to become an Admin. 
oppose,IMHO El C still needs more experience working in this community. only 648 edits to articles and almost more edits to user talk pages than edits in articles. also I am not impressed with how El C acts in pressure situations. Maybe I'll support at a later date. 
oppose,Change vote. 
oppose,I'm little hesitant to oppose because El C has some very good contributions to articles and is always civil but reviewing his old dialogue with (all that Comrade nonsense) and other supportive comments <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Village_pump_%28miscellaneous%29&diff=prev&oldid=11308577> about egregious leftwing POVpushers leaved a bad impression. I'm afraid El C could became a trollfriendly admin. 
support,Not that being confused with Lord Emsworth is anything to be ashamed of either. 
support,German based articles looks very good. We need translators.
support,Sure. 
support,Definitely. 
support,I've been very impressed with Ellsworth we've had some minor disagreements and he's maintained a positive and constructive attitude throughout. 
support,Very valuable contributor. 
support,Cool. 
support,Fine editor. 
support,Of course. 
support,being a banker by profession I have remained associated with financial matters and relevant law and taxation. I saw some of Ellsworth's edits and found them 'worthy'.
support,He maintains a level head and he deals with articles on politics? What's his secret? 
support,entirely. Enochlau has been helpful to the community.

support,Though I'm unfamiliar with Essjay's work any potential trollslayer backed by some top editors is good enough for me.

support,Cool.
support,50 to 1? Sounds fair 
support,I haven't been around very long but all of my experiences with Essjay have been positive. Great candidate for adminship. 
support,I've decided after a lot of thought that Essjay is good enough for adminship and I support this because I think Essjay deserves it now before I really had no true reason to not I was just angry at myself. 
support,Greets a lot of new users and works hard on the RC patrol. 
support,support obviously. 
support,Very active doing RC patrol and would benefit with the admin tools.

support,Consistent activity over a long time. Highly involved in the project despite low edit count (he's a developer people!) 
support,Yes please not obviously unhinged. 
support,Excellent answer to my question deserves credit for having been here a long time. After three years as a Wikiholic it's ok probably healthy for one's edit count to drop. 
support,The use of the edit summarys is very good I changed my vote based upon the fact that this user has been here for so long and is still here making edits. I've been here for just a few months and I've had small lulls in activity before.

support,&#8766; Obviously understands Wikipedia policy to the point of creating pages two years ago which were accepted as guidelines and are still widely cited today. Obviously experienced in Wikipedia administration as a consequence of his creation and subsequent maintenance of [[Wikitravel]]. Trustworthiness obviously established. Obviously not a MayDecember romance with Wikipedia; he's in it for the long haul. Will obviously be an asset to Wikipedia itself if given the mop and bucket. I'm croggled that people are actually debating the frequency of his edits given all of the foregoing. → 
support,low activity is of some concern but there is zero evidence of bad activity; hence my vote to support.
support,as a longterm reliable contributor. You definitely seem like the type of person who is intelligent enough to familiarize themselves with policy before using it. 
support,per Extreme Unction. I am croggled too though I had to look it up to be sure. There is absolutely no reason to think he will misuse the tools. The focus on recent edits of a consistent long term user makes no sense to me. 
support,I thought he was a developer already and he is which tells me he is quite involved in Wikipedia just in different areas that I don't frequent. 
support,I think I was a bit hasty in my formation of my initial opinion. I think this user would make a good admin and really help wikipedia. 
support,of course. Been around longer than most anyone. Low edit counts are reasons against only when it implies newbieness which is obviously not the case here. BTW his answer to the IAR question should be enshrined in the rule itself. | [[User talk:Asbestos|<FONT COLOR="#808080">Talk </FONT]]> 
support,Low edit rate is not a reason to deny adminship. 
support,If we trust him to work on the software we should trust him with the content. 
oppose,Fewer that 200 edits in the last year shows you're barely involved in Wikipedia at all. Additionally the coverage of your edits over that period misses a lot of the important matters that are the meat of an admin's enhanced role warning vandals AfD copyvio there's little evidence that you're properly uptospeed with the rules and mores of Wikipedia as they stand to day (and <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:H%C3%BCsker_D%C3%BC&diff=prev&oldid=11079462 evidence> that you aren't). There's no need for someone to be an admin to be more involved. 
oppose,Low activity.  <200 edits in last year... 
oppose,due to edit summaries and low activity.
oppose,Not a lot of recent activity though if your new activity continues would probally support next time; several vandal reverts but not followed by User talk messages or warnings needed for dealing with repeat vandals. You want to work on tricky technical parts of wikipedia but failry low or nonexistent edits regarding categoriestemplates and/or their discussions. 
oppose,per lack of activity. 
oppose,lack of activity. 
oppose,although user shows experience with old policy and guidelines alot has changed over time... low recent edit count would definately cause a lack of familiarity with modern policies/guidelines. Perhaps if activity level increased I would support in the future. As for now... I must oppose. 
oppose,lack of activity in last year. 
support,Of course. &#8212;

support,He's got my vote 
support,The first support comes free with the nomination. 
support,I would have liked to have nominated Extreme Unction. This user caught on extremely fast and has been doing cleanup work and showing that he has the knowledge of Wikipedia policy and temperament for adminship since he started. When you look at his low editcount take a look at the quality of the edits and I think you'll agree that he's earned our trust in a fraction of the time it takes most users. As he says in question 3 below he has shown a high tolerance for the abuse of other editors and has handled conflict with calm and rationality. Let's give this user the tools that will help him continue to dazzle us.
support,Not many edits but beign an admin is supposed to be no big deal so...
support,per CaF and Gator. [[Image:Flag of Europe.svg|20px]][[Image:Flag of Austria.svg|20px]] 
support,Has a strong understanding of online communities; good editing record; plenty of user interaction. 
support,EXTREME UNCTION SUPPORT. (Sorry.Someone had to do it.) Another one I was thinking of nominating myself. Has the personality and experience to do this well caught on to WP quick and wants to do the grunt work. Works for me.

support,Good user in AFD 
support,[[Wikipedia:Esperanza|ε]]
support,user is unlikely to abuse admin tools. AFD issues don't bother me the existing rules about who can do what closures are rather foolish anyway. 
support,Need more admins. 
support,First of all after reading his response to Splash I have to definitely leave a vote here. (No it wasn't the Wile E. Coyote quote that did it but that was nice) I don't think that someone should be punished in an RfA vote if they realize their mistake and openly and honestly admit that they were wrong. Too many editors it seems are not willing to do such a thing. If he's learned his lesson let's give him a chance to do the job that he wants to do. This person looks like someone who has the potential to be very beneficial to Wikipedia. 
support,I've never seen such good responses on an RFA. 
support,Support per in particular and all of the above in general. 
support,I was on the fence about this because of the low edit count and dabbling in arcane stuff like closing AfDs (OMG STANDARD LEVEL USERS CAN DO THAT?!??!!) but he recognizes his mistakes and is very well spoken in response to criticism. 
support,Everyone makes mistakes no reason to hang the man over one.... </big> ([[User_Talk:Vilerage|Reply]]|[[Special:Emailuser/Vilerage|Spam Me!]]
support,work with ISP's impressive and may prove beneficial.
support,firm grasp of policy. Think he's too green? Then ask yourself this: do you trust him to ask before he does something he's unsure about? I know I do. [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,Good answers concerns about editcount and AfD closes seem minor to me. 
support,Very competent and ambitious editor willing to learn from mistakes. 
support,Not a troll vandal or idiot; wellintentioned committed and rational. Less than X months experience? Less than Y edits? Please. Let's not pretend like Wikipedia is so difficult that only an intensive and longwinded study could give you the necessary experience to do the admin thing with care. For some people this might be true. Those don't become administrators. Many more qualify than some might think though. 
support,Content matters. Supprot. 
support,Very helpful in dealing with AfD of a new article. 
support,He may have a relatively low edit count but per Bishonen he seems competent and ambitious. No doubt ISP abuse skills would help the project too. His recent <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:UkPaolo&diff=29589187&oldid=29491319 explanation> regarding an AfD convinces me that he does have the required understanding of the process. └
support,seems like an alright user and has a reasonably good understanding of AfD. I'm fine with nonadmins closing nonconsensus AfDs and I think he does a good job with it. 
support,I've seen him around and he seems OK. 
support,Good article <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dobie_Gillis_Williams&diff=prev&oldid=30141191 edits> good <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Circumcision_advocacy&diff=prev&oldid=30110185 comments> and since when can nonadmins only close keeps? I must go look at history of [[Wikipedia:Deletion process]]. 
support,Changing vote to per information contained in vote #36. There's nothing to show that he won't make a good administrator even with a lower than usual edit count.Give him a mop and bucket
support,It takes something to make me vote. Extreme is a great guy. Note to others: there's no better way of getting me to support than opposing solely on the basis of vote count or account age. I was chosen as an admin after just five months and Extreme seems happy to do the work so why not let him? Do you really think he's going to abuse the tools? If not you should support because we need all the admins we can get. 
support,not a vandal troll asshole sockpuppet or idiot and most of the oppose votes do not give me any reason to oppose. 
support,I like this fella's style 
support,He's been doing good work and I see no signs that he is hotheaded unreasonable or other warning signs. I have every reason to believe he'll do just fine as an admin. 
support,For great justice. 
support,Yes it's early but Extreme Unction has shown himself to be of administrator material. I am confident that if he is lacking experience dealing with nonAfD situations he will quickly gain it and be able to use his admin powers wisely. 
support,Let me first state that I've been extremely impressed by his contributions. I very rarely support a candidate with less than 1000 edits but I almost did here. The reason I'm not is because I think he could use another month or two. I am a bit concerned that he's been closing AfDs as noconsensus. I think it's great for nonadmins to close obvious "keeps" but it's up to an admin to decide whether there's consensus or not. In a month or so I will strongly support. 
oppose,It pains me to oppose since I assumed he already was an administrator when I first interacted with him just two days ago. That interaction was over his close of [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Better Off Dead (Soundtrack)]] where he stated that the merge was already complete and so the article should be reconsidered for deletion. However at the time <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Better_Off_Dead&oldid=28703455 the merge target> contained only "The soundtrack for Better Off Dead was produced by Robert Hine" and the merge source had not been made into a redirect. Most importantly the GFDL only allows us to delete merged articles with very great care. Like how to deal with vandalism the authorship requirement of the GFDL is something that every administrator needs to understand thoroughly before they get their extra buttons. I'd be happy to support or even nominate once he has some more experience since he's clearly on the right track. 
oppose,I must join Carbonite in his concerns but I share them a bit more strongly. I too thought you were an admin because I've seen your "no consensus" closes before. I think you do a good job but those closes leave a bit of a bad feeling so I think more time is needed. 
oppose,Some misunderstandings of things are ok we all make them. But that particular one comes up quite often on AfD (several times a day probably) and a duly experienced editor would already be aware of it. The fact that he is closing AfDs is good but he shouldn't be closing noconsensi because that's what admins are for and trusting their judgement in such things is part of why we have RfA. ([[Wikipedia:Deletion process]] is also very clear on the matter; presumably the editor hasn't read this document.) I would like to see a convincingly firmer grip on procedure and policy particularly in this area since he indicates interest in adminning it and its closely related deletion processes. I would also like more than a few hundred edits to judge consistency and style by (don't start on me). Also anecdotally Extreme Unction has only very recently come to my attention: at the risk of sounding selfcentered I see most good RfA candidates long before they turn up here and I was quite surprised to see his name and more surprised to see he is in fact clear of 3 months. I am drooling at the thought of having an ISP's abuse admin as a Wiki admin in the future however. We should give him [[m:Checkuser]] access now probably. 
oppose,<6 months and <1000 edits. I'm also concerned that the user's best contribution to Wikipedia was an argument in an AfD discussion.
oppose,Not quite enough edits and most of them are afds . Need to get around more here. There's more than afd. Vandal fight spread your edits around and try again in a couple of months you'll get it then.
oppose,Opppose for now needs more experience. Will gladly support if and when this person is renominated. 
oppose,Needs more experience 
oppose,as above 
oppose,Way too low an edit count 1) for us to make an accurate judgement on their suitability for adminship and 2) for Extreme Unction to have the knowledge of the ins and outs of the Wikipedia that an admin needs. 
oppose,as above: needs a little more experience. See no reason not to support next time however. 
oppose,due to lack of experience.
oppose,at this time due to experience criteria but I certainly do encourage this editor to keep contributing.

support,Regarding the opposition citing conflict with Sam Spade (1) lots of people have problems with Sam Spade and (2) adminship is not a free ticket to "get the upper hand in a conflict". Incidentally RfA is not a free ticket to engage in [[WP:NPA|personal attacks]]. 
support,I see no evidence of disruption from FeloniousMonk. Only evidence of him being a fine user. 
support,I didn't know FM's work very well before looking into it here but this is a good editor. Having been in conflict and shown how s/he handles it is one of my admin criteria and FM's opportunities in that area have apparently been outstanding. AFAICS he has acquitted himself very well. 
support,Good addition. [[User Talk:Texture|τ]]
support,This is a horrible mess but FeloniousMonk seems to come out of it well. He looks as though he would be a good administrator — he has integrity. 
support,after careful considerartion of arguments from both sides. 
support,no reason to think that FM would abuse admin powers. 
support,←
support,Strong Finally! [[Image:Alexander_cuts_the_Gordian_Knot.jpg|thumb||200px|Somtimes you just need to [[Gordian Knot|cut the knot]].]] Ok. How many folks recall that I actually wanted to nominate FeloniousMonk at one point in time. Show of hands! Eh? That's not many. Ok well then. At one point in time late last year I wanted to nominate FeloniousMonk. For folks just tuning in this might be hard to believe but. Well he'd just concluded a public informal mediation with Rednblu with Hawstom acting as the mediator and all 3 parties had conducted themselves admirably. So I nominated Hawstom that went well and rednblu was #3 on my (random order) list first let's try Felonious. And that's where I got kinda stuck. There was some kind of impedence mismatch and I couldn't get through to him what I wanted to see as assurance that he'd do well. Strange experience that :/ It actually ended up at the mediation commitee fancy that. Now as it turns out the mediation comittee has the extreme misfortune of not having counted Slimvirgin among their members. (S)he managed to solve the [[gordian knot]] in oh I'll wager just under 5 minutes. Thanks ;; Right well so... why am I supporting? Well FeloniousMonk typically did do well in negotiations before (just not with me but that's covered now ) and seems to be doing well elsewhere. And indeed he has amazing integrity and perseverence. Maybe he could try for bureaucrat in a little while. 
support,Professional edits has shown a willingness to compromise and (in general) an ability to remain cool in the face of provocation. 
support,I took sometime to think about this: good editor with good people supporting him. 
support,plenty of merits all described above. 
support,a scholar and gentleman. 
support,Well. I always supported personally just didn't want FM to be admined in the midst of entrenched opposition cause that would've been ugly. It seems to have all gone away. 
support,Full support.
support,Responds well to the hailstorm of criticism from the [[peanut gallery]]. That would be a good quality in a admin. 
support,Valuable editor decent person no doubt a good admin. Who didn't have conflicts? 
support,Suuport. A levelheaded and reasonable contributor. 
oppose,Highly partisan and sometimes disruptive editor. Exhibits [[clique]]ish tendencies with the nominating administrator that are unhealthy for Wikipedia and may unduly bias the administrator pool. 
oppose,I can confirm his cliqueish tendencies based on his behavior at [[Intelligent design]] where he admitted reverting not on the merits but because others had reverted the same items. He requested protection for the page not in open channels such as the official protection page or on the talk page of a neutral admin but instead by some other undisclosed communications channel from Slimvirgin who is evidently an admirer based on her recommendation here.
oppose,No mention of dealing with vandalism anywhere in this nomination. Seems to be obsessed with . 
oppose,Strong Oppose. Feloniousmonk might be a good editor but his character is unfortunately unsuited to adminship. He cannot deal with conflict. Felonious appears obsessed with Sam. Disruptive. Partisan. 
oppose,Sorry but controversy = no support from 
oppose,I find the opposition persuasive. 
oppose,I don't mind conflict but it shouldn't be your main purpose in being here. 
oppose,I haven't made an edit in 1 month+ but this is just too much. 
oppose,Your conflict with SS needs some time to cool off before I can support your nomination. 
oppose,Conduct with SS seems to have pushed you over the edge 
oppose,Sorry but there are problems that must be addressed. I'd be happy to support if it comes up again in a couple months and these have been resolved. 
oppose,Strenuously oppose. You have got to be kidding me. This is the editor who told me that Wikipedia is here to record "[[Talk:Human/Archive8#Handling_the_competing_points_of_view|the facts]]" not understanding or eliding that there is disagreement over "the facts" and that this disagreement is what makes Wikipedia different from other encyclopedias. FeloniousMonk does not understand NPOV. He doesn't recognize the distinction between facts and values. He boasts on his of "opposing irrationality including organized religion." (Yes I know the text is borrowed from .) That opposition manifests itself in his edits. That is to say: FeloniousMonk is an antireligous POV warrior. To grant FeloniousMonk adminship is for Wikipedia to take a step away from NPOV. Additionally his repeated insistence on "[[User_talk:FeloniousMonk/Archive_Apr_2005#Comments_of_mine_deleted_by_Sam_Spade_from_his_Talk_page|justice]]" in the tiff with SS is troubling should justice be understood as retribution? 
oppose,Argumentative. Conflictive.May the Force be with you!

Then there is <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Freakofnurture/&diff=31165179&oldid=25901019 this odd statement>.

oppose,Weak oppose. I have no objections against him as an editor and this is the first time I ever oppose a RfA; but his attitude of contacting other users who like him had voted against my RfA based on edicountitis in order to establish a common baseline to oppose other "inexperienced" users from becoming admins <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ABahn_Mi&diff=24107556&oldid=24106512> dissapointed me. 
oppose,I am sorry Freestylefrappe but learning how important you feel edit counts to be I'd rather see you get more experience first. If your vote should fail see that as an opportunity in your personal evolution as a Wikipedian.
oppose,Weak Oppose. While I can place trust in you I don't know if you know all the WP guidelines yet. Back in late August/early September in my own RfA you said that "you cannot become an admin until you have made 1000 edits". Sorry.

oppose,Sorry I have to agree with Proto. The "get out the vote" campaigns show poor judgment. Garnering for "oppose" votes on user talk pages shows poor judgment and it once became an ArbCom issue. The case here is much less severe but it still makes me uneasy. 
oppose,Weak oppose as I'm not really happy with FSF's response to the criticisms above. 
oppose,per Proto. Even if his actions were in response to his previously being denied adminship that doesn't mean he needs to run around ensuring that no one else with low edit counts becomes an admin either. It seems kind of immature and isn't the kind of person who I would like to see be an admin. Also I think that people should use <nowiki>{{subst:test}}</nowiki> as an initial warning on a talk page instead of <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:66.201.182.98&diff=prev&oldid=24209698> in the spirit of [[Wikipedia:Please do not bite the newcomers]].

oppose,From weak neutral after I suddenly found this on my talk page<Please remove "not even Durin...". This is inappropriate and pointless. freestylefrappe 02:14 20 October 2005 (UTC)> Unfortunately this confirms in my mind the concerns raised here. Much anger is there in this one.

support,Most certainly. I'm slightly astonished that [[WP:CIVIL|incivility]] is being proferred as a reason to oppose Friday of all persons. The quality of Friday that has always stood out to me the most—and the reason I assumed until now that she was a longtime admin—is a certain unshakeable equanimity and poise that she maintains in discussions even when attacked. We may not require of our admins that they never involve themselves in conflict but we can expect them to maintain an even keel have a willingness to entertain different points of view demonstrate a firmness in upholding policy—and no less the grace to apologise for their errors when these are pointed out to them. Friday is all these; taken with her editing experience I think she's a shooin for administratorship.
support,Yes seen this editor being sensible and thoughtful in various places. Good 'un. 
support,Cool. 
support,Friday's a great editor and is extremely helpful and polite. I'm surprised that Denelson83 offers below <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Friday/archive2#Your_lack_of_civility this> as an example of incivility when in fact it shows the opposite: civility in the face of dealing with a difficult user which is exactly what's needed in an admin. Friday's just the sort of editor who ought to be promoted.

support,Delighted to support. Func's more than qualified to use the tools well; I think his own answers already say it all. 
support,He's not alreafy an admin!?!?! 
support,See line above mine. I mean what the hell. :P 
support,Not a difficult decision at all. 
support,This is the first time I've had to use that ol' cliche: you mean he's not one already?!? 
support,lolZOMFGSRSLY i thought he wuz teh ADMIN alraedhy 
support,didn't even have to think about it. 
support,me too 
support,I thought he was an AdmN already. Clearly has strong knowledge of Wikipedia procedures. 
support,Unconditional support. 
support,absolutely. Although together with 's RfA this will reduce even further the entertainment available to me on NP/RC patrol! I'm just going to move to a different timezone I think. 
support,with pleasure and without reservation. 
support,What he isn't already a sysop?! This guy reverts vandals faster than a roadrunner on crack! Give him the mop! 
support,Obligatory support as a brainwashed member of his micronation. =) 
support,Strong I can't wait to see him on RC patrol once he has admin powers although he might put me out of a job . 
support,I quite agree with all of the above.. 
support,for all the foregoing reasons. 
support,functional editor. 
support,Helpful on the RC patrol and reverts vandalism quickly. 
support,A fine Wikipedian. 
support,Strong 
support,I love you func. 
support,I sure thought he was one already when he explained to me how to deal with a dispute. And without a doubt the best answers to the standard questions I've ever read. 
support,I was starting to wonder when would get a nom. 
support,Very active doing RC patrol and reverting vandals. 
support,Uh I think I know why the cliché is a cliché after all: I really did think he was one already. And he needs to be. 
support,"Faster than a roadrunner on crack." That's good enough for me! 
support,Huh? He wasn't an admin? *kerblink*. 
support,! This guy saved my usertalk page from a vulgar vandal last night. 
support,Especially with note to the cliche mentioned above. 
support,I didn't know he wasn't an admin! 
support,I thought he was already an admin. 
support,With the greatest of pleasure and a very big smile. I'm just distraught that I'm as far down as #39. I was a bit slow off the mark for you there Func. 
support,Good work Func... 
support,Should make a decent admin. 
support,unquestionably. Will make a great admin. 
support,Anyone who survived Irismeister and Mr. Treason and remains a productive and pleasant human being deserves a much higher reward than this. Wholeheartedly support. 
support,ofcourse. 
support,CRAZY vandal fighter. Of course I think being an admin should be no big deal... at least I hope its not one of those who require 8 months and 10000 edits :\ 
support,This shouldn't be hard at all.Forgot to sign. 
support,Another vandalhunter who should be an admin. 
support,I thought he was already... 
support,yeah me too. 
support,Thought he was one already. 
support,Definitely. 
support,101% *insert sheep vote here* No but seriously you answered the questions that way I wish most nominees would. And your sense of humor earns you a bonus point. 
support,Good work against vandals admin powers would be helpful in this. 
support,with the obligatory "I thought he was already!" comment 
support,yet another "thought he was already" 
support,Thought he was one. 
support,Of course 
support,I'd vote oppose but he has to break the record :P 
support,[[:Image:KoolAidMan.jpg|Oh Yeaahh!]] 
support,More than once have I been on RC patrol ready to revert vandalism or slap a speedy delete tag on a page where I find that Func has beat me to it. Exactly the kind of admin we need. 
support,Hayeuppp. 
support,Good editor with a level head. (Figuratively of course.) 
support,Like so many others on this page had no idea he wasn't an admin already. 
support,I've been impressed by him at VfD. 
support,About time! Func should have become an administrator long before I. 
support,Strong . [[User_talk:bmicomp|(talk]] 
support,! 
support,Func has clearly made a positive impact on Wikipedia and by his editing record seems to be a good candidate. 
support,Absolutely. 
support,[[Special:Contributions/Who|∞]]
support,Obviously. 
support,Still unsure as to what it is or what it is made out of! 
support,Bring in the func! 
support,Dang this is what I get for looking at RfA too rarely. I'm like #80 or something. 
support,I wonder if this vote actually matters at this point... 
support,Hell nothing wrong with showing overwhemling to a great user. I RC patrol in the middle of the night so I can have something to do! 
support,How could I not support someone so strongly endorsed by the community? 
support,EXTERMINATE!!!!! 
support,Now that my RfA is over I can support. | [[User talk:Flcelloguy|A note? ]]</font color>| 
support,100% by which I mean support. Let's get this over with so he can start blocking vandals. To be honest... I thought Func already was an admin! 
support,and happy to help try to beat the record. 
support,<nowiki>{{</nowiki>ithoughts/healreadywasone|he}} ;) 
support,I honestly thought he was an admin already. 
support,(though it worries me that Boothy443 is voting for I thought that his antivote was a prerequisite for adminship).

support,Gee I almost missed out on being able to vote on this. 
support,user.support = true 
support,Nice to see many of the edits have edit summaries too! 
support,Cool. 
support,User has good knowledge of wiki software responds intelligently to questions posed on user talk and article talk pages and gives out guitar lessons on his talk page? Sounds good to me. 
support,Didn't find anything to object. I can judge SW related edits and these are is acceptable. Some edit summaries are insufficient. Finally thanks for your help with vandals. 
support,Looks good. 
support,That link about world domination seems a little controversial (it does show your sense of humor) but overall great user; therefore I support. 
support,Very good user also shows that he understands the purpose of adminship. 
support,Extremely strong support. Not just extensive WP participation but a contributor to numerous other wikis too. Seems like an allaround swell person. 
support,Robotassisted disambiguation performed on art... whoops. Looks like my botmaster was being stupid... I'll go hang out with Dogmaster4000 over in kindofsockpuppetbutnotreally land... 
oppose,Does not meet 
support,Of course. 
support,Strongly. 
support,Sure. 
support,Easy decision. 
support,I've seen him around and was actually under the impression he was already an admin. . 
support,Absolutely. 
support,If it looks like duck ... Following the previous RfA I've noticed Fvw strenuously behaving like an admin walks like a duck ... helping out on many of the forums that keep WP tidy  and quacks like a duck ... and making numerous sensible decisions ...then it just may be a duck. so support. 
support,Sure. 
support,I assumed he already was an admin. Absolutely support. 
support,I actually asked fvw if I should nominate him for adminship <unfortunate typo corrected> at roughly the same time as SWAdair. of course 
support,thought he was an admin already (hoping once you are an admin you won't act like an "uberadmin :o) 
support,Never come across this user in my contributions but I have looked through Fvw's and was impressed by the variety and extent. He's got my vote. 
support,absolutely. a tireless wikijanitor. understands & respects policy. very strong support 
support,Sure thing.
support,Yet another user whose work to keep things running smoothly has been so tireless I did not realize he was not yet an admin. . 
support,Definitely suport 
support,I thought he was already. 
support,Dude is all over the VfD and the new pages slaying trolls left and right. He'd also make a great intermediary on VfD regarding articles on the speedy delete borderline until the policies are changed. 
support,Would make a great admin. 
support,<Insert unspeakable RfA cliche here>. 
support,In my experience his opinions and actions derive from a very reliable sense of NPOV and the best interests of the project. 
support,I've seen a lot of his work over the last month or so and I'm very impressed.
support,Ironclad support. A great vandalfighter and janitor to boot. 
support,Obvious. Should be an excellent admin. 
support,ed last time and I don't see anything has changed since then. 
support,Very Strong Back from grave to support you. 
support,I too thought he was already an administrator given his incredible work on Recent Changes. Would be glad to see him an admin. 
support,As if you even need my vote! 
support,I didn't realise you weren't one 
support,Superduport. 
support,he does very good work. 
support,absolutely. 
support,support I think that added responsibility will make him more calmly. 
support,I would have sworn he was already an admin but apparently I'm crazy. 
support,Very impressive statistics. 
support,I'm surprised he didn't become an admin the first time round. 
support,with reservations. See objections below regarding speedy deletes. 
support,Sorry I didn't get to vote sooner I strongly support this candidate.
support,I didn't vote here yet? Wow. Of course I support. His RC patrol is great. 
support,I support based upon the opposition which I find unconvincing in addition to my own experience. 
support,His edits are sane he's more than willing to discuss he'd be a great admin 
support,A bit wary of his deletionism (which is more extremist than mine) but a fine editor otherwise. 
support,Ditto on assuming he was already an admin. Would clearly benefit from being able to rollback and block vandals. Opposition is unfair: having a specific perspective on deletion is irrelevant so long as he abides by community consensus. 
support,fvw has been a great help during my beginning days on the 'pedia. He has given me good advice on the Wiki way. Perhaps could do with being a little less abrupt on occasions but I think he would make a firstclass admin. <I believe this vote is by ; added by 
support,See comments below. 
support,despite his deletionism ;) 
support,Janitorial work is a plus. 
support,The amount of janitorial/etc stuff he's already doing has impressed me no end. 
support,Do you know I thought he was already... 
support,O yea 
support,No doubt. 
support,One of our greatest vandalstoppers I've seen. Total support 
support,The concerns of others have me concerned. [[User_talk:Ugen64|64]] 03:52 10 Jan 2005 (UTC) Firsthand experience moves me to support. 
support,why not? 
oppose,Too many occasions where I personally disagree with his decisions. Too prone to simply revert substantive edits without adding to discussion so rollback access would be unsuitable. 
oppose,The evidence of the childish exchange between Fvw and the vandal Mr Avenger indicates that Fvw does not display the maturity required of a sysop on Wikipedia. It is important that adminship on Wikipedia is not treated like a "club" but rather proffered on people who have the necessary skills and maturity to be up to the task. 
oppose,I have the same objections as Rob the Bruce and Netoholic. 
oppose,Nope. He's improved a little but I cannot support anyone a/ whose view on speedy deletion is so far from policy b/ who talks about "slapping vandals" and c/ tries to write policy by the back door. We have enough of those already.
oppose,As Fvw admits himself all of his time here is spent 'patrolling' RC and tagging things most frequently fD. He has practically no experience of writing or editing articles which is actually what Wikipedia is about. It would be nice if instead of tagging articles and leaving them for others he actually did some of the work himeself. Further being a strong 'deletionist' I very much doubt he will arrive at objective conclusions when evaluating consensus on VfD pages. 
oppose,Still too early (less than 3 months of continuous activity). It's annoying how people are always trying to force this. Whenever an RfA fails someone will just renominate after a month or so. 
oppose,I currently oppose. Fvw needs more time here and needs to prove a fairer interaction with users and the database. 
oppose,strong concerns expressed....
support,Gabbe has been here for several years has made over 5000 edits and doesn't seem to have been involved in any major controversies. 
support,This should be easy. 
support,Definitely an admin given his experience. 
support,Quiet but industrious it seems. Need more of them! 
support,Neutral for now due to your answer to question #2. I might change my vote if you change your answer to that question. [[User talk:Lst27|(talk)]] 20:48 13 Jan 2005 (UTC)

support,My support too. 
support,yes of course. An asset to the community. 
support,How does one say support in Aramaic? 
support,I like what I see in his history. He has had a lot of edits and has been around since 2003. I think he can be entrusted with additional authority. 
support,Blessed are the peacemakers and I might add the ones that provide quality content. 
support,per nom. 
support,of course. 
support,[[WP:ESP|e]]
support,How could I nominate and not support. 
support,Absolutely. 
support,Cool 
support,A good and prolific editor an even temperament and makes some useful and wellobserved points on his user page. Will be an asset to the sysop pool we need more people providing for [[WP:DYK]]. 
support,for the same reasons as Dbiv. Has been qualified for a while but declined previous offers to nominate. 
support,I don't recognised any of the other Wikishipsproject editors that nominated today but is a sensible editor I would endorse. 
support,Excellent choice for an admin! 
support,Hey it's the battle guy! 
support,a strong editor/contributor. [[User talk:RoyBoy|Boy]] 
support,Yes please. 
support,levelheaded editor. Came across him in November and again in March. Has turned down a nomination in January. Would indeed be a good help at [[WP:DYK]].

support,Very evenkeeled cooperative editor; I really did think he already was an admin : ) 
support,Excelent editor 
support,Entirely appropriate. 
support,Good researcher of materials honest mediator and other attributes make this editor an excellent candidate. 
support,I have had the pleasure of working with Goodoldpolonius2 on a number of articles including the [[History of Jews in Poland]] and no matter how controversial the topic he has always kept his cool and could be counted to help with moderation. More power to him! 
support,A great editor who cares about policy and has a lot of common sense. 
support,confident this user will not abuse admin tools. 
support,Good editor and vandalfighter. 
support,Excellent editor good consensus seeker will use tools well. 
support,per above comments. Good editor. 
support,for 9 more years until you have 10 years experience of course 
support,If he/she is not deserving who amongst us is? 
support,good excellent use of edit summaries especially to discuss changes in "controversial" articles. Normally I don't vote where I haven't had any interaction with a user but in this case the contributions speak for themselves. 
support,Indubitably [[user:Celestianpower|Cel]][[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,Great user and even has a sense of humor! My type of admin.. I'll be watching you Goodoldpolonius2 
support,I have seen him interact with a nationalist POVpusher. He has patience.
support,Good editor shows good judgement and will make a good admin.
support,A year is clearly enough time on Wikipedia.

support,as an apology for all the messages intended for me he gets on IRC :> <! yes and because of all the other reasons too... 
support,seen good things. 
support,great vandal fighter and has helped me out with reverting multiple occurrences of vandalism on a page. As he said in his answers to the questions he's already doing admin tasks so it makes sense to make him an admin. 
support,Not sure what more there is to add at this point. 
support,I thought I already voted here. GraemeL totally deserves it he helps fight back vandals all the time. 
support,[[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]

support,Looks good. | [[User_talk:Linuxbeak|Talk]] | 
support,been here for a long time and wasn't involved in anything bad. 
support,will make a good admin. 
support,and damn the editcountitis. Good users don't need 4000 edits to be worthy. 
support,Graft is objective perceptive and tenacious... qualities that serve him well. Give him the mop. 
support,this user is quite observant and conscientious. I think the admin tools will be used wisely. 
support,I do not believe that a numerically high rate of contributions per day should become one of the myriad prerequisites for adminship. 
support,Low use of edit summaries is not quite enough to discount all the other positive factors to consider but should be corrected as an important courtesy to others. 
support,wants to contribute has been steady 
support,too qualified be left without a mop in his hand. 
support,Would prefer to see more edit summaries though. 
support,Cannot find reasons to oppose. 
oppose,this person has been here since 2002 and only has over 2000 edits. Any passive editor could do that in three years. I don't think you're qualified for adminship. 
oppose,Seconded although this user has lots of time on wiki 50% of the total edit content is talk pages <http://kohl.wikimedia.org/~kate/cgibin/count_edits?user=Graft&dbname=enwiki>. Perhaps its just me but I think admins should be doing more article editing/creation than just talking. Graft please dont take this as a personal afront what edits you do have are very good and quite useful but it seems very low and very little for such a long time as a user. 
oppose,Nominee has been here long enough to understand policies and their application. Edits look good. Seems a decent candidate with two exceptions; low use of edit summaries and the fact that the user is not on frequently enough to be a successful administrator. Administrators need to be available in contact and participating in ongoing discussions/debates. 1.2 edits per day over the last 90 days is just too low of a participation level for me to feel this admin will be successful. 
oppose,Oppose for reasons stated above. 
support,Extreme As nominator 
support,as Conominator. [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,Freakishly Strong based on my positive interactions with this editor in various fora particularly [[Portal:Law]]. 
support,HULK SUPPORT

support,GregAsche is a very courteous RC patroller and has sufficiently proven his dedication to this project. 
support,Supprt as everyone above. 
support,Yes. I will cast the first support vote for you. With over two years of contributions and a demonstrated quality of accountability the admin hat will fit you quite well.

support,I see no convincing reason that the user cannot be trusted with the key to the janitor's closet. 
support,Will be a good sysop
support,Cool. 
support,Change to Handy user. Sorry for the first oppose. 
support,I find his answers to the questions unconvincing. A selfnom should have clearer reasons for wanting to be adminified. [[User_talk:Radiant!|adiant]][[meta:mergist|_&gt;|&lt;]] 08:33 July 15 2005 (UTC) I find his new answers a lot better so I support. 
oppose,very shaky grip of policy. Answer below says he thinks that an admin can delete/rename categories on sight when there's a well established procedure. 
support,as nominator. 
support,but use more edit summaries? [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,I very rarely vote here but I've met Gren in person (he goes to my university) and I find him very trustworthy.

support,Go for it. 
support,I've seen good etc. 
support,Seems like a good one. 
support,I know I tend to say "RFA cliche #1" a lot but this time I really seriously thought Grenavitare was an admin. I can't say I remember having any specific contect with him but he's one of those users whose comments you see around and think "that's exactly what needed to be said." 
support,[[WP:ESP|e]]
support,I found myself on the other side of discussions with gren on various talk pages and despite the occasional disagreement always found gren to be good to work with and a positive presence on the whole. I think gren'll make a strong addition to Wikipedia's admins.>

support,There's nothing else to say then. . 
support,Grenavitar shows exactly the kind of maturity needed to stop edit wars and other hostility. For example the exchange on [[Talk:Ali_Sina]] demonstrates his eventempered accommodating yet truetopolicy stance against an onslaught of POVdriven attacks. We need him as an admin! 
support,see him around a lot. 
support,Gren is levelheaded civil even when highly provoked evenhanded and prepared to seek compromise. He's exactly the type of editor who'll make a good admin. 
support,Excellent choice. Same reasons as SV. 
support,I didn't even know Gren wasn't a sysop but he should be. He seems to be knowledgeable and civil and would be a great admin
support,That was simple. Mr. Gren obviously has some skill and has passion in all that he does. His sincerity shows through and through with his edits and comments and I have full faith in his dedication and that his adminship will be an asset to farmers worldwide. _ 
support,as per . 
support,Strong 
support,The more decent admins the better! 
support,as per Irishpunktom . 
support,again I thought I had done already. Sadly I was wrong. [[user:Celestianpower|Cel]][[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]

support,THE STRONGEST SUPPORT CONCEIVABLE Okay so I really really really tried to oppose gren I mean he <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Rydia&oldid=20204797 vandalized> my user page however he was looking over my shoulder while I voted and well I just didn't have the heart to say no. Is pity a crime? 
oppose,till user sets/enables his email id. 
support,No doubt a valuable user great warrior in the perpetual battle against plain stubs (sounds more dramatic than it really was!) 
support,Hells bells and buggy wheels... you mean he wasn't...? 
support,Strong mop and bucket candidate if ever there was one! 
support,Anybody who's willing to do all that long hard work on stubs has to be adminworthy. 
support,seems like a great user and yeah I kinda thought he was already one too. 
support,Of course. 
support,I have had the pleasure of working with this user on the Wikiproject Stub Sorting for the past few months and have nothing but positive things to say about him. He is committed and reasonable. I sincerely believe that he will make an outstanding sysop. Thus I give him my full support. 
support,As with I've worked on the Stub Sorting project with . He's very proactive with feet planted firmly on the ground. Happy to support! 
support,That's a lot of mopworthy grunt work and so a strong support for you. Keep being bold! 
support,by all means 
support,Cool. 
support,Indubitably. 
support,By making the stubs more specific makes it easier for people to find articles/projects that suit their particular areas of interest and expertise. A daunting and worthy project and wellcarried out. 
support,Me too!. Bless his soul for ridding us of unsorted stubs. 
support,So that's who's been sorting out all those stubs I mark doing RC patrol. 
support,Does good work and shows evidence of being helpful to work with. 
support,Excellent editor 
support,Ground Zero has made significant contributions to Wikipedia through his edits his vigilance and his community spirit. Would make an excellent admin. 
support,I don't believe the criticisms in the "oppose" section are accurate or valid. Kevin/GZ has consistently shown good judgement as an editor and has been scrupulous in the pursuit of accuracy. He probably should have been made an admin some time ago. 
support,A good positive pleasant communicator on talk pages this user has made a subtantial contribution to the wiki as a whole through a diverse range of edits made. Shows good knowledge of Wikipedia processes and procedure. Wholeheartedly support; Ground Zero shall make an excellent admin I'm sure. 
support,Ground Zero. 
support,(assuming he accepts of course). As the awarder of said Barnstar I have seen and appreciated the contributions he's made to Wikipedia. Zero has made a lot of contributions to Canadian articles: he has done a lot of "behind the scenes" maintenance work as well as content edits to contentious political articles. I think he can be trusted with the mop and bucket. 
support,Glad to give Ground Zero my first RFA support. I am certain that he is trustworthy of the admin tools. He is already active in vandal patrolling and is often seen both in foreground of Wikipedia writing articles and in the background mopping up talking out and working on the structures of WP. In my experience he is courteous and shows good judgement and patience in dealing with others. 
support,Thank you for bringing my mistake to my attention. 
support,Ground Zero has been a tremendous boost to many a Canadian article serving as an unofficial "administrator" of large projects already with great success. 
support,We need more vandal patrolling.
support,Willing and ablre member of the community. 
support,I like the fact that he concentrates himself in a certain area .. Canada in this instance. 
support,even though he's a tory ;) 
support,[[Image:Caonsb.gif|20px|Flag of Scarborough ON Canada]]
support,support 
support,support 
support,A person who is so dedicated to his country and Wiki deserves my vote 
support,Tends to treat Canadian pages as his own personal property seems to oppose the notion that Wikipedia is free to edit. I don't think this user would use admin powers wisely. 
support,I don't think he can be neutral when acting in an offical capacity. [[Image:Ottawa flag.png|20px]] 
support,Neutral He hasn't either accepted or answered the questions. I think he's probably a good candidate and so long as there's nothing in the questions that makes me think otherwise I'd gladly support. 
support,Seems like a great user who routinely goes to VfD and has contributed many quality edits to Wikipedia. It seems time to hand him the mop work on the edit summaries though! 
support,It's just a useful thing for me to have a Russian speaking administrator in English WP. Besides I know Grue is a very sober Vikipedician. 
support,A very good user. 
support,Pro. 
support,Seems like a worthy candidate. 
support,Because he'll eat you if you don't. Grues are like that. 
support,Good inclusionist. 
support,Cool. 
support,It is pitch black. You are likely to be eaten by a . 
support,Grue is an inclusionist? Yay! (of course not for that reason alone).
support,mmmhmmm. 
support,Suppport If RickK thinks he is too inclusionist that is worth a vote from me. 
support,Very active on vfd an inclusionist and a great contributer. 
support,Weak Very active on VfD which can be a pro and a con and i've had a minor dispute with him over [[Radio KoL]] and its importance. However is a good user and I think could be a good administrator but its only a weak support due to lack of article namespace activity. 
oppose,Too few article edits. Also pursuaded by the thoughtful comments in the section below which lead to the conclusion that this editor is not yet ready for admin but may well be in the future if those areas are addressed. 
oppose,Neutral constructive personality but I'm somewhat put off by the lack of edits to mainspace. We do need organizers and cleaners in Wikispace but it's important not to lose touch with main. Changed to oppose because I see no effort in addressing the issues raised by neutral voters and oppose voters which would be especially important for a selfnom. Would probably support a couple months from now though. 
oppose,In light of Shmucky's comments I have changed my vote to oppose. 
oppose,I won't support anyone even inclusionists who concentrates on VfD rather than creating content. Would reconsider in a month or so if I'm reminded to. 
support,Strong contributor. 
support,I had been watching wondering when Gadfium would reextend the offer. 'Glad the wait is over. 
support,I remember reading your articles as a judge in Danny's contests and was sufficiently impressed. You . 
support,Definitely yes 
support,Sure. 
support,Wow. 13000 edits! Definitely support. 
support,Wow. Why isn't he an admin already? 
support,Very much so. 
support,He has not only organized the stub situation but managed to gently cajole me into using the new more specific geostubs despite my grumpiness about being slowed by having to learn a bunch of new stuffclearly not only a good contributor and organizer but also good people skills; excellent combination for an admin. 
support,Very much "yes" from me.
support,I was very impressed (well) with Grutness participation in Danny's Contest. 
support,Wonderful editor. 
support,Well obviously. 
support,Wonderful editor. . 
support,First class. Made a couple of small early mistakes and learned from them and never looked back. Great example of international cooperation. 
support,One of the few the fine the crucial. 
support,Most definitely support. 
support,not that you need another though. Keep up the good work and [[Wikipedia:Cite sources|cite your sources]] 
support,Convinced me! 
support,Yes. 
oppose,Will support at 14000. 
oppose,He accepted humbly. He shouldnt be humble. 
support,Dog goneit NSLE beat to the punch support on this one :D 
support,unlikely to abuse administrator tools. 
support,Well articulated answers and a processoriented approach grab my support.

support,Good guy. Need them. ➨ [[User_talk:Redvers|❝]][[Wikipedia:Esperanza|E]]
support,if the only opposition is reliability of participation. 
support,I've seen his good work around easy to support 
support,Hope to keep seeing this users edits in my watch list. 
support,<nowiki>{{cliche}}</nowiki> 
support,For his Don Quixote efforts to bring some sort of sanity to BC/BCE edit wars. 
support,An excellent contributor. 
support,some editors can't spend all day all year online (see Zodrac below). But great (friendly!) work. 
support,support another goody. 
support,Seen him around. Good! 
support,Consistent work in [[WP:AFD]]. 
support,I think that there's a tendency to underestimate the value and importance of things like stubsorting and wikifying. Nor should a constant presence be a requirement; people have other responsibilities that get in the way. What's more important to me is a willingness to help the project and I think that GTBacchus has definitely shown that. 
support,Only recently did I come to view this editor's work here at Wikipedia as a tangent from a topic of mutual interest. He will do well with Admin tools and powers. I have no worries in supporting this proposal. → 
support,will make an excellent administrator. 
support,Looks fine. 
support,should do well. 
oppose,I was going for support on this one due to the wonderful intro until I checked his summary <http://faleg.org/cgibin/wannabe_kate?username=GTBacchus&site=en.wikipedia.org>. Sporadic? Not "really" active? A good amount of edits in July huge amounts in October and a good amount in November. Reliable? Probably not. Basically this is a newbie in disguise. Looks like he will be good but just too new for me and too sporadic. 
support,How could I nominate and not support. 
support,I've had othing but good experiences; should make a levelheaded and sensible admin. 
support,Anyone Dr. C. supports must have his good points ;) and anyway he seems to know how to use the tools. 
support,Definitely support. 
support,Strongly support 
support,Yesindeedy 
support,Nothing but good edits. 
support,He's good at dealing with those (e.g. myself on at least one occasion) who aren't as wellinformed as he is. 
support,A very good user and a very strong candidate. 
support,A very good editor and interacts well with other users. 
support,Seems like a solid contributor but uses edit summaries roughly half the time and should consider using them more. [[User_talk:Radiant!|adiant]][[meta:mergist|_&gt;|&lt;]] 08:33 Jun 14 2005 (UTC) Addressed my concern so support.

support,Strong I like that Guettarda takes responsibility for his statements and actions. 
support,Still waters run deep. 
support,his positive qualities are far more expressive than his negative ones. 
support,Good contribs. 
support,support 
support,Impressed by his ability to argue passionately without abuse. This shows an ability to confront issues appropriately and I admire that. 
support,Exactly what we need. 
support,Strongly support.
support,Cool. 
support,as a new user to Wikipedia I have found 's input very informative and well presented and in a respectful manner. already appears to be an experienced Wikipedia scholar and I think that this online consortium can only benefit from his clear headed perspective. 
support,Edit history indicates he will use admin powers responsibly. 
support,Arguing passionately for one's position is not inconsistent with responsible stewardship. The ability to accept disagreement is a fine quality in an administrator. 
support,Seems to know what's what. 
support,I very much support the idea of nomination for Guettarda to "adminship" status. 
support,Seems like a good editor. 
support,support How'd I miss signing this one? 
support,Valuable contributor who gets along well with others. 
oppose,Regretfully. I felt he was not willing to even consider compromise on CE/AD and given the heatedness of the issue he should have done. 
support,per above. 
support,again I applaud Durin for his amazingly wellcrafted nomination and there isn't all that much I can add ;) [[user:Celestianpower|Cel]][[WP:ESP|e]]

support,Durin's Beard. 
support,no reason not to.

support,impressive work...
support,An impressive effort from a diligent editor. 
support,good editor. good admin candidate. 
support,well and truely. If Durin can't find anything wrong with this user then noone can! 
support,this user is unlikely to abuse administrator tools. 
support,Sorry I'm so late support.May the Force be with you! 
support,Wonderful editor well aware of wiki system. 
support,Would make an excellent admin. 
support,of course 
support,we need more like Gurubrahma!
support,likely to be an excellent admin. 
support,Excellent user 
support,highly qualified user. 
support,Super strong support :( I wanted to nominate him but I guess I will write an essay on him despite being trumped on that count by durin. In the seven months he has shown a ability to quickly grasp wikipedia policy and communicate the same to other users. He is an excellent editor and I really appreciate his insightful additions to diverse articles. He is also quite active in the [[:te:Main Page|Telegu wikipedia]] and helped translate [[economy of India]] to [[Telegu]] on my request. And he is extremely friendly to other users and remains cool as a cucumber despite regularly contributing to some contentious pages. Here's hoping he beats my [[India]]n record of [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Pamri|50 votes]]. 
support,wow I'm late! GB is a mature editor and I've seen him handle many situations quite well. 
support,looks OK. 
support,Yup. 
support,Durin is quite strict with what he considers a worthwhile nomination for RFA based on his guidelines I'm gonna have to support this one even though I have had no interaction with this user. 
support,Oops didn't notice this nomination earlier. Full 
support,Gets my support jai hind! 
support,Gurubrahma is tireless in reverting vandalism and he keeps his temper in trying circumstances. I have worked with him on several articles and I have nothing but praise for this Wikipedian. 
support,If this person meets Durin's rigid criteria then they have to be worthy of adminship. 
support,Good vandal fighter good contributor. 
support,I haven't voted yet! Strong 
support,and I was actually waiting to nominate him but just could not come here for days. And I may be late to the party but feel happy that at least I could come here and find the nomination. This gives me a lot of satisfaction. I have found him to be one amongst the best an asset to the Project. 
support,good editor.
support,Supoort. Gurubrahma's contributions are enviable and he has the ability to emote an aura of progress and acomplishment among those he comes into contact with in some ways the essense of this project. I am so glad that we can give Wikipedia a gift: Gurubrahma as an admin.
support,Strong candidate. 
support,sure. I think noone is voting because the edit counter is down LOL. 
support,the edit counter is down but I don't really care about that anyway. Looks like a solid contributor with good community interaction no reason for him not to be an admin. 
support,trustworthy and knowledgeable. 
support,good editor. If anyone does care I count 3216 well distributed edits as of this moment. 
support,strong editor will make a great admin. 
support,3000+ edits with no apparent bad ones satisfies me. 
support,the musicabal. The mop and bucket are in order here. 06:27 27 September 2005 (UTC) (unsigned comment from ) 
support,no personal interaction with Gyrofrog but a review of edit contribs looks good. He just barely passes my edit count level though. 
support,No reason not to support. 
support,contribs seem solid and I trust some of the previous voters. Haven't come across him myself admittedly. 
support,I've run into Gyrofrog several times now (including last night) and always been impressed. 
support,of course (pending acceptance by nominee). 
support,Meets my unwritten requirements. 
support,Oh good now the cabal can finally have a good hall monitor to keep track of the little people. But seriously lots of I've seen good work here. 
support,Good vandal fighter. 
support,He's like those kids whose parents named them "Grace" and they became a dancer or "Hamburger" and they became a fast food magnate. . 
support,Lol Golbez. Anyways good user and well deserving of adminship. 
support,This user has demonstrated significant commitment to performing vandalism cleanup requests for sourcing claims etc. which show this user would definitely benefit from being granted administrator privileges. In addition Hall Monitor has shown significant commitment to the Wikipedia community as a whole and shown civility politeness and ability to assume good faith in communications. In short I am certain this user shall use adminship well. 
support,[[User Talk:Texture|&#964;]]
support,Absolutely. 
support,The username says it all... would make very good use of a mop and bucket. 
support,Always friendly! Plus returning the favor ;)

support,Awesome name. 
support,duh! support good work so far... admin material imo. 
support,has done excellent work on vandal cleanup. 
support,Talented vandal slayer. 
support,Active against vandalism. 
support,Very active in editing carries out a lot of the less glamourous stuff that must be done. 
support,A trustworthy vandal fighter and wikifier. Hall Moniter is really helpful and friendly on Wikipedia and I see no reason why we should oppose. 
support,I haven't had a huge amount of contact with Hall Moniter but the interactions I have had with him make me confident that he would make good use of adminship. 
support,Will make a a good admin and vandalbuster. 
support,I've always been impressed with the way he handles himself around the site. 
support,I hesitated initially because of some vague recollections about listings at [[WP:AIV]] that I felt were overly aggressive despite appreciation of his vandal fighting. However after a little investigation I find a proper caution towards questionable cases am reassured by his responses below and am confident he will be measured in the use of his admin abilities.
support,Does great work in fighting vandalism. 
support,give him the attack mop! 
support,Cool. 
support,Levelheaded and determined. 
support,Harrumph! 
support,Good very active editor. Hand him the mop. 
support,I've seen him in action on occasion and liked his style. 
support,Nice contributor and helpful. 
support,An edit conflict when voting is usually a good sign (glares at Edwin). 
support,Helpful editor and lots of good Article edits despite the short time. RC patrol is also much easier when he's around. 
support,Good editor. 
support,Excellent work 
oppose,Three months is too short a time to be promoted. 
support,Coolest name ever by the way. 
support,Trust the nominator. Good work by editor so far but please increase edit activity a little. 
support,! I have had good interactions with this editor he was once spoofed twice by a vandal over two weeks (by and ) and I helped him sort that problem out to the extent that I was able. I have observed his contributions since then and have no fear that he will misuse or abuse the admin tools. 
support,Good editor good sense of humour sensible voter. 
support,plenty of activity accross the board (with the exception of Image talk ;))and all of it good. 
support,Ditto with DmcDevit. 
support,I'm female afterall [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]

support,I'd want a hamster sandwich. 
support,I've worked with this editor and know for a fact that he is safe pair of hands. His judgements in AfD have been uniformly good and balanced. It's unfortunate for Wiki that reallife has been a distraction recently but that doesn't diminish the quality of the potential admin. 
support,[[Wikipedia:Esperanza|Э]]
support,I trust the Hamster Sandwich to use the mop wisely and well. 
support,Good contributor. 
support,I thought about the concerns voiced below for a while as I was surprised at the lack of talk and project edits but then I thought about it some more and came to the conclusion that not having much to say to other users isn't necessarily a bad thing. From HamsterSandwich's edits and behavior (including stepping right in the middle of some of the fractiousness right off the bat) I believe him to have the poise and calm necessary for the added buttons. 
support,Geogre said it for me. 
support,Why it's Hamster Sandwich! 
support,In agreement with User:Geogre.
support,unlikely to abuse admin tools. 
support,With my complete confidence. 
support,His contributions merit promotion. I had 1300 edits when promoted which means his timetoedit ratio is better than mine. 
support,After extensive review I have concluded that this Ham Sammich will make an outstanding addition to the Jewish Cabal that runs Wikipedia. (Or whatever pet theory the detractors subscribe to...) [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,A little slim on the edits but what I've seen has been very good work so... 
support,Keep. For a hamster he's doing very well.

support,without hesitation.

support,Happy to support this fine Aussie editor. Cheers!! 
support,dedicated to keeping the wiki vandal free must be mopped. 
support,Troppus noelip emertxe. 
support,Definite support. 
support,he took our criticism of his last 2 RFAs in stride and has shown a marked improvement since then. I think he's ready now. 
support,His cool and courteous handling of previous constructive criticism makes me wish some current administrators were more like him. 
support,Cliché support. [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,No longer does it stand at 50. 
support,I'm a little late to the party 
support,"Sorry I'm so late" support. 
support,Speedy for the reasons given. Plus he's French and likes the kitties. 
support,Hashar is going about this the right way. The request is unusual compared to what we are used to dealing with but the reasoning behind the request is sensible. And clearly Hashar is trustworthy so it is easy to support this request. 
support,Been here for over two years I see? Well that translates to a definite support. 
support,Seems fine to me. 
support,I am very grateful for anyone with the skills and dedication to be able to contribute to the development of the technical side of Wikipedia. If this makes life easier for Hashar in that regard by all means support. 
support,Though I've never encountered Hashar here I've confirmed that this user is a [[m:Developers|developer]]. He could just as easily given himself the sysop access but didn't. I respect that a great deal. 
support,of course. If he can be trusted with developer access I think he can be trusted with the powers of a mere sysop. A good trustworthy fellow who shouldn't have to go find someone else to fix the MediaWiki: namespace. 
support,I thought developers had admin access by default but I guess that's not the case. 
support,Goes without saying. 
support,Anyone who votes against must really hate Wikipedia. And kittens.
support,Has a very good and specific reason.
support,I thought he was. 
support,Do developers really have to do this? Evidently they do. . 
support,Cool. 
support,for three reasons. He's a proven good sysop. Admin abilities are useful for a developer. And Nut and Bolt my two cats told me to. 
support,he gets my full support 
support,Certainly. 
support,since selfnominations need "super consensus". 
support,Mais oui! Excellent and trustworthy.  14:48 19 July 2005 (UTC) 
oppose,Insufficient reasons for nomination. 
support,Nominating user 
support,ing with pleasure Hedley should have got it last time. 
support,Yup. 
support,I'm pleased to support. 
support,I opposed last time due to my concerns over Hedley's good faith. I am now completely convinced and I was going to nominate myself in a couple of days time. 
support,As before. 
support,After a month I am confident enough in Hedley to support. | [[User talk:Flcelloguy|A note? ]]</font color>| 
support,Since last time he has shown that he is worthy. 
support,very much. 
support,I've seen some of this user's work here and say sure hand him the mop. 
support,Seems like a good and trustworthy user. 
support,why not? 
support,I trust that you will work for the good and harmony of the community. I hope you don't dominate the Child prodigy page and allow others to edit within concensus and policy. Still I am confident that you will be a good administrator. Condidering also that there are a lot of vandalisms trolls etc. out there.
support,support good editor good contributions in general... may have had some problems in the past sure but who hasnt? 
support,ed before will again. Mopworthy. 
support,should already have been admined 
support,Excellent contributor. 
support,No reason at all to oppose. 
support,Hedley is sane. That's important and it's not all that common. 
support,Since this is right on the edge I'll suspend my nonRFA voting stance for this vote. 
oppose,User lied during previous RfA. 
oppose,it is less than a month after the previous nomination failed (or technically was withdrawn). Many of the comments in there were regarding Hedley's lack of experience so I feel that that still holds now. 
oppose,Oppose. Do not know the user but less than one month since his vocally opposed candidacy does not seem a long enough interim. I also disapprove of his comment on Allen3's RFA candidacy (below) needling someone for not explaining his vote. 
oppose,Too soon and Hedley displays an alarming (if somewhat charming) naivety of the complexity of our social interaction coupled with a lot of eagerness to be bold. This could only be a bad thing if coupled with the ability to act. 
oppose,Please look at the previous nomination. My concern remains what it was then. 
oppose,Only one month since the previous nomination. 
oppose,Severely oppose. I don't think that Hedley is ready yet to be an administrator. Maybe later not yet. 
support,Vote was fairly close last time (I would have voted neutral swaying towards support had I voted). Henrygb has clearly made good efforts to improve the shortcomings noted enough to sway me all the way to support. 
support,Looks fine to me mind you I'd have supported the old RfA too. 
support,Earlier arguments against him being an admin didn't hold water 
support,Looks good.
support,Should have been accepted last time. 
support,A solid contributor. I nominated Henrygb last time. 
support,Cool. 
support,as before. 
support,I think 7 weeks is a somewhat thin interval period for a renomination but I support anyway. 
support,and comment that it's a tribute to how an Admin nomination can turn a good editor into an even better one. 
support,support User clearly wants to be an admin
support,Looks good to me. 
support,Wow you've got a better contrib history than me! 
support,Thanks for dealing with vandals and spammers. 
support,Cares about accuracy. 
support,as nominator. 
support,Excellent candidate. 
support,Yahoo! 
support,She's been asking all over the place on how to follow procedure properly which tells me quite a bit about her being suitable for the mop and the flamethrower. You've got my support just promise that you're going to wander away from [[Harry Potter]] every once in a while. 
support,In like her concise and convincing answer to my question. I see no reason to doubt that she'll use her newfound powers well. [[user:Celestianpower|Cel]][[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,I trust the nominator. 
support,I trust her and the nominator but less than 1000 edits overall is a slight worry though. But Im nice and will vote support 
support,Full I'm confident in her abilities and when she didn't know what to do she would ask. So don't worry about edit count. [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,I would point out that being useful and responsive on the Help Desk indicates a good admin temperament and intimate knowledge of the workings of Wikipedia. Low edits may mean inexperienced but not in this case and it doesn't look like the opposers have done much research if they really want to say that. 
support,I have already seen her mediate and defuse a situation between {{user|Albus Dumbledore}} {{user|Chosen One}} and {{user|Draco Malfoy}} vs. {{user|Mikkalai}} and handled herself admirably she really helped calm things down. I look at her earlier edits and see her asking others before doing things the first time out of an abundance of caution. Looking at her edits I see that it is strong on Talk User Talk and Wikipedia Talk. She engages the community which is a great sign. I might oppose a candidate with low edit count (especially with low on talk pages) because there may be too little indication of how the person interacts with others. However I think Hermione1980's editing history gives us ample examples of how she would behave as an admin and what they show is right on target. 
support,Has welldemonstrated all the qualities needed in an admin. 
support,From what I see Hermione1980 has done plenty of good work and has plenty of experience and that outweighs any concern about the edit count being fairly low. 
support,I've seen her around and she's a good editor. .
support,Strongest possible support. Hermione is a prime example of applying editcount criteria for adminship can lead us to make poor decisions. While the number of her edits is comparatively low looking through them one can see a few things: (1) the quality of her contributions is uniformly high. This is someone who is careful and deliberate and takes each submit seriously. Such people are naturally going to have a lower edit count than someone else (like uh me) who fires off edits in staccato bursts. (2) She has been here for a long time and demonstrated her commitment to the project. (3) Her willingness to seek consensus (for example via article RfCs) rather than just hammering her opinions home mindlessly is great. I think she absolutely shows the temperament and commitment needed to be an admin. I urge those of you who are voting based solely on the number of her edits to go the extra mile and actually examine those edits more closely; I think if you do that you'll consider changing your vote. 
support,[[WP:ESP|e]]
support,I do like to see 1000 edits from a candidate but I won't oppose her for being a few dozen short. In my opinion there's nothing wrong with being a low(er) activity admin. 
support,this should be no big deal! This user has established her trustworthyness to my satisfaction and never before have editcounts have seemed so utterly frivolous... 
support,Trusted? Yes. Long term experience? Yes. Good at dealing with conflict? Yes. Quality edits? Oh yes. Has an arbitrary number of edits? Who cares! 
support,Alohamora. Quality user and I find the opposition unconvincing. 
support,Sure could use a few more edits but it seems churlish to object on those grounds. Looks like a solid reliable contributor. And I hope you don't mind that I ship you with Ginny. 
support,Low edit count is meaningless if someone is committed literate and willing. This candidate has given creditable clear and concise answers to the questions posed below and seems well Wikipediaminded. That should do. 
support,I like the answers to the q's. 
support,The "low" edit count doesn't concern me. I like the answers I like the attitude. I feel she's demonstrated that she's trustworthy. 
support,I see no good reason not to. 
support,and damn the editcountitis. 
support,(
support,I've had the pleasure of getting to know Hermione1980 over at the Harry Potter WikiProject but I have nonetheless run into her in a multitude of places across the wiki. She is a mature thoughtful editor and I have no doubt in my mind she is completely qualified to be an admin. She has been here for several months one of my criteria. Personally I like to see a higher edit count but in this case my personal knowledge of the user overrides that and I can vouch for her that she is an excellent candidate. Wikipedia cannot have too many quality admins and Hermione1980 would be a wonderful administrator therefore her low edit count should be overlooked in recognition of the quality work she has been doing for Wikipedia. 
support,From what I've seen of her (mainly working on Harry Potter articles back in July) she definately seems to be admin material. 
support,Oppose Advertising in one's sig strongly suggests that the candidate considers adminship more than "no big deal". Further such behavior suggests that the candidate does not have a full enough understanding of Wikipedia's culture at this time. Otherwise appears to be a very good candidate. Please remove the reference from your sig and return in a few short months. 
support,Normally I would say there is nothing wrong in seeking a little more experience of pressing save and having to live with the consequences than this edit count implies. However Hermione1980 demonstrates considerably maturity beyond her edit count and I have been especially impressed at the responses to this RfA. If this RfA succeeds she might consider branching out a little from Potter and should be careful never to use the admin buttons to settle any disputes on those articles. 
support,X factor. We require a reasonable edit count to provide the substrate to decide if a User is experienced and suitable. Once that is already clear a high absolute count matters less. 
support,I have seen some good work done. Good editor. should make a good admin. [[Special:Contributions/Who|∞]]
support,Great editor and contributor in all kinds of subjects. 
support,Yes please. 
support,Extreme Wingardium Leviosa ! 
support,it is the quality of the candidate and their contributions which should matter not quantity.
support,Hermoine1980 oppose editcountitis. 
support,I cannot believe I am going to . What is the world coming to? But seriously Hermione is a great editor and can be trusted with the tools. A little while back I was thinking of people that would make good admins and she was one of the first people I thought of (although an even lower edit count prevented me from doing so). [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,The edit count may be a little low but I have found her to be circumspect and reasonable. 
support,A fine user dedicated to Wikipedia's betterment. · 
support,! Incidentally she is now only 19 short of the magic number. I trust those 19 edits will be good ones! 
support,edit count is irrelevent user has done tons of good work. 
support,upgrade from comment to support...school comes first and surely she'll still have some time to be an admin...Good luck!
oppose,Less than 1000 edits suggest lack of experience. 
oppose,[[Opera|Oppose]] Lacking edits lacking experience. 
oppose,too few edits. 
oppose,too inexperienced also the "advertising" in her signature for this RfA I find distasteful. 
oppose,nothing personal but this is way too low a level of activity for adminship. 
oppose,per Fadix. I'll support in a while. 
oppose,Seems like a very good editor but not experienced enough in my opinion. I'd like to see more edits to a wider variety of articles but beyond that I don't see any reason I would oppose in the future. 
oppose,for the time being until this editor gains more experience. 
oppose,too new not enough edits... cant predict trends yet... sorry maybe later. 
oppose,As others this is too early. I also like to see a more regular level activity in admin candidates because the wiki world actually can change pretty fast. (Though I totally understand and respect the need to devote much of one's time to college.) 
oppose,too few edits imo 
oppose,don't really care for edit countitry but sub 1000 would be a bad precedent 
support,of courses! 
support,nothing but good experiences with this user. A good vandal fighter I think he can live up to the high expectations of an admin. 
support,but are you the kid that punches horses or the kid that was punched by a horse? 
support,A good and experienced wikipede and a ruthless vandal fighter.May the Force be with you! 
support,yeah. Looks good as far as I've looked through his contributions. [[Image:Flag_of_Austria.png|15px]]

support,Make it be known on the record that stole this nomination from me and then went and took the corny support statement I was going to use grrr. HorsePunchKid is always helping people on the [[WP:HD|Help desk]] and becoming an admin will expand his scope there. He also fights vandalism and leaves some of the best edit summaries going around. Lastly he's a good bloke great have around.

support,he voted neutral on my RFA so the kindergarten side of me was tempted...buuuut he deserves it and admin is no big deal so why vote anything but support for a guy like this.

support,I have seen his work and he will be a good admin.

support,He really isn't one yet?

support,Of course! 
support,Hard workers are always needed. Pass along the extra mops! 
support,Howcheng is a name on Wikipedia I am familiar with and know I can trust. 
support,Was planning to ask him if I could nominate him next month. Oh well this is even better. 
support,Very active good editor. 
support,Seen Howcheng around quite a bit good work. 
support,with the quickness but he needs to remember too many relistings clog AfD (particularly if the decision is an obvious one). 
support,I must be confused with how adminship works. Howcheng! has been closing AFDs for ages now and I always feel comfortable with his closings. Is one of the best if not THE best closer going. And I am sure that everyone here knows how critical I am of AFD closers. You can trust Howcheng! 
support,No big deal. If you were planning on thanking me personally please don't. 
support,I thought he was a good closing admin but now I learn he's not an admin. Obviously he should be. 
support,Hyper VfD I thought he's an sysop already!

support,see Mailer's reason

support,Does not need my support by the look of it but nevertheless I do 
support,Agree with all the above... 
support,I loved the fact that recently he went through and found old AfDs with no votes because they hadn't been listed properly and bumped them to ensure they were properly debated. That screams sysop material. Hope to see him around. 
support,More support than a house of cards (an oblique reference to this being the 53rd vote). 
support,Solid candidate. 
support,unless the deck has two Jokers... then I'd be the one to crash the house; the house that support built! [[User talk:RoyBoy|Boy]]

support,Few days go by that he hasn't brought up an orphaned AfD. 
support,Good consistent work and fair comments on AfD. I'm surprised he's not an admin already. 
support,Another solid Wikipedian from California. 
support,Will be an excellent admin with his involvement with AFD. 
support,Of course he would make an excellent administator. 
support,Seen him around before. 
support,I may of voted already though? :p

support,=No Big Deal. Hfool has been consistently impressive within a short period. 
support,Am I convinced of good faith? YES. 
support,Good work on VfD calm and rational would make a fine admin. 
support,Humblefool impressed me greatly when I inexplicably (to him anyway) reverted his edits twice in a case of mistaken identity. He was polite then and I haven't seen anything different since. 
support,I have bumped into the user a couple of times and had no negative experiences; seems to have his head on the right place. 
support,Seems like a good user has sufficient experience with multiple namespaces and is a fellow deletionist. I also like the fact that during the recent [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion/Proposal|CSD proposal]] he put a notice for that in his signature to remind other people to vote on the proposed changes to policy. 
support,my usual "fits the criteria on my userpage" reason that's sufficent information for me to support 
support,I guess he's just [[The Humble Guys|got]] 
support,experienced user. 
support,I was impressed by his conduct during the [[user:Iasson|Iasson]] [[Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Iasson|RfC]] and [[Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Iasson|RfAr]] and I've seen nothing since to suggest his other conduct has been any less than what I expect of an admin. 
support,Familiar with WP procedures and I agree with Thryduulf. 
support,I've come across this user's work before and I have no reason to think he'd be anything less than a great admin. 
support,Always professional and pleasant on VfD. His exemplifies the kind of conduct that is expected of an admin. 
support,Polite contributor who does good work. 
support,Good and experienced user. Deletionism is never a worry when I consider candidates. 
support,Very impressive work with VfDs and the imageboardrelated articles. 
support,I don't like the bit about being deletionist but I'll have benefit of the doubt. 
support,In my humble foolish opinion we need people involved in the arbitration and new page patrol.
support,Agree with the above. 
support,We could certainly use more humble admins. 
support,Hayupp. Deletionist or not Humblefool does good work. 
support,for the humblest of fools. 
support,Despite the fact that I couldn't convince him on IRC to mail me money for this vote I will vote for him anyway. [[User_talk:Kmccoy|(talk)]] 03:02 1 #* Talked to him on IRC seems to know his stuff. 04:16 1 August 2005 (UTC) I am invalidating my votes. See my user page for my reasons.
support,Seems to have a history of fine quality editing. 
support,Sharp and levelheaded. Would have no problem exercising care as a sysop. 
support,Good work with VfD and even though you're a deletionist I think you'd make a fine admin. 
oppose,1607 in 13 months isn't very impressive. But edititis isn't why I'm voting against you. You make it known that you are a deletionist. I can respect that. But if the only you want to be an admin is to put pages up for speedy deletion and VfD I don't think you deserve this job. 
oppose,Editing speed is so slow that he/she could easily be a sockpuppet. ( | | 
oppose,Not enough edits. 
oppose,for the same reasons as Dmn.

support,Duuude.

support,about time! 
support,per everybody. 
support,I remember that the first interaction I had with Ianblair23 was to nominate one of his articles for deletion... he handled that case very calmly and civilly.

support,He's not? Wait somebody must be kidding. Let me check the [[Wikipedia:List of administrators|list]]... Whoa! Seriously he's not listed. ! 
support,He...isn't...an...admin? Wha? This is an outrage! 
support,I support.

support,as the nominator. 
support,(nods head) 
support,I'll happily support Ingoolemo. I haven't worked with him very much but I've been pleased with the results when I have. 
support,Great user and contributor. 
support,Finally my I was positive he was already one virginity is gone! I don't feel any different though. 
support,Fine. 
support,The article cited below about the [[B32 Dominator]] impresses me; anyone with the drive and talent to write effectively and at length about an obscure trivial but nonetheless notable topic wins my respect because they clearly aren't doing it for fame/money/sex or other temporal transient reasons. Ingoolemo is a warrior monk; silent faithful humble and lethal. I like using commas punctuation marks I like to write breathless sentences declarations that have a lot of adjectives describing words in them like a [[adder|slithery snake]] made out of words and concepts.
support,Meets my 
support,Looks like a great wikipedian 
support,From what I've seen he stays cool calm but firm in his dealings with other editors in overheated situations. 
support,I RC patrol very rarely but it seems like every time I do I get into edit conflicts with him trying to slap a <nowiki>{{delete}}</nowiki> on some piece of nonsense or other. 
support,A very good janitor he deserves the golden mop and bucket. 
support,Great chap. Absolute support. 
support,Cool. 
support,I was on RFA anyway [[Talk:New_York_City#Reorganization]] (near the end) shows how Inter is very capable of solving conflicts. Once he's built up some experience as an admin he might also consider applying for mediator or arbitrator. 
support,Good janitor good problem solver. . 
support,I nominated Inter last time and still support. 
support,support good editor if perhaps a bit light on total # of edits. 
support,I remember coming across Inter's edits. He really should be able to rollback. . 
support,Inter would make a great admin. 
support,(because people dealing with vandalism are most needed now IMHO). 
support,support. I am suprised to learn that Inter is not already an administrator. 
support,Yeah. 
support,Just like last time. 
support,Pavel said it best. 
support,as before. 
support,Suppport. Helpful janitor and spambuster. 
oppose,Does not meet my and am concerned when one of a user's two proudest edits is just to add one full stop! 
support,as nominator. 
support,All over the place and doing a good job.
support,meets and that's good enough for me. I'm also glad to see him improving in the area of edit summaries. 
support,[[Image:Symbol support vote.svg|15px]] Extreme lesbian support! But i would like to see more edit summaries. 
support,a good vandal fighter. (I also agree with the others regarding summaries) 
support,but please use edit summaries. 
support,No argument.

support,No problem with Ix has beaten me to rvv a number of times. 
support,[[Wikipedia:Esperanza|ε]]
support,will be a fine administrator. 
support,Meets my one standard: Making him an admin would help Wikipedia. The absolutely torrid pace of edits doesn't hurt either. 
support,Strong Another I thought he was a admin already 
support,A first rate vandalhunter. Despite his relatively short time here he seems familiar with policy common practice and the Wiki culture. I'm sure he'll make a great admin. 
support,The user's gained a lot of respect from the community because of all her/his contributions and vandal fighting. I believe we will always see more from this user. 
support,Maybe I need to start checking [[Special:Listusers]] but I thought Izehar was an admin! 
support,I have frequently come across this editor on RC patrol doing useful things and following up on them. Would make a conscientious admin I think. 
support,will make an excellent janitor.
support,without reservation a hardworking respectable contributor. 
support,Everything seems to be in good order here! 
support,Strong vandal fighter. 
support,a very good editor and a fellow vandal fighter.

support,<cliche>Already thought he was one</cliche> <font>&laquo;
support,for good article contributions and excellent vandalismhunting. 
support,because I thought I did an hour ago! And because I've had good interactions with Izehar who has made good contribs as well as done some good antivandal work. 
support,unlikely that he will abuse administrator tools. 
support,Fine friendly user nominated by fine friendly user. Has my confidence. 
support,Daniel Brandt is a twofaced double crossing mongrel as he just showed today. He didn't appreciate a single frigging thing I did for him and instead insisted that I'd "prematurely ejaculated" to use his words and ruined everything. So he can go screw himself. I thought that he of all people would appreciate someone trying to help but he can't. So forget it. He's a mongrel. Say what you like about him I won't object. And as for you Izehar well you did the right thing and wrote on my talk page and didn't overreact so you did your bit. I am sorry that I was so vigorously supporting this guy. I thought that he was just hardly done by. It turns out that he has no honour whatsoever. 
support,seems like a good level headed editor 
support,Good and responsible contributor. 
support,Most definite support yeah. [[Image:Flag_of_Europe_and_Austria.svg|20px]] 
support,no brainer great editor.
support,of course! A certain boon to the ranks of admins.

support,You've got to be kidding me. Izehar's not an admin? OMGWTF SUPPORT. 
support,Good track record should use tools well. 
support,Very Strong My friend Izehar I'm happy for you! Izehar is one of the users that I like most he is calm friendly and a good user. I trust him to be one of the best Administrators. We truely need people like him. 
support,See him on the vandal front often. –
support,Zocky clearly has it in for this user. You should always annoy at least one troll before being considered for adminship. 
support,Good editor knows how to apply Wikipedia's policies to resolve disputes. 
support,Will make an excellent administrator. 
support,Lightningfast "vandalverter". Thought he was one

support,trustworthy. Great editor. 
support,Excellent contributor to the CVG articles. Should make a good admin. 
support,One of the best contributors to CVG articles. <font>&laquo;

support,Should make a good admin. 
support,Good admin candidate 
support,[[Wikipedia:Esperanza|ε]]
support,Will make a good admin. 
support,Perfectly trustworthy and that's all that is required of an admin. Remember "adminship is no big deal!" 
support,admin is no big deal so I won't be nit picky about where he chooses to edit. User has earned this.
support,Good editor. 
support,Seen Jacoplane over at CVG wikiproject as well as running into him on RC patrol. 
support,a familiar name. 
support,removes vandalism and if Jacoplane was an admin Jacoplane could block persistant vandals and when really needed protect pages 
support,thought he was one... 
support,for short time I'm here in Wikipedia was sufficient to see how important Jacoplane is. Is very educated and excelent mediator/contributor. An example to be folowed. 
support,Don't know the guy but what they hey. 
oppose,While it is good Jacoplane has participated in several WikiProjects he doesn't seem to be familiar (or at least active) in any of the major processes in WikiSpace. Judging by the answers to his questions he has interest in becoming a Mediator which is laudable but doesn't require adminship. 
oppose,very short answers to the questions shows a lack of effort. 
support,Naturally. 
support,An excellent editor. 
support,good editor. 
support,Glad to see a good editor that takes on canadian issues. Wiki can always use more responsible admins. 
support,Excellent stuff about Ukraine. 
support,absolutely. Happy to see his name pop up here. 
support,No previous familiarity with this user but since edit counts are a very poor indicator of trustworthiness I reviewed his edit history. Every edit I saw was good faith and I saw many very positive contributions. We are here to write an encyclopedia so content creation is to be encouraged. That said I also see enough community interaction and a pattern of editing that reflects a user worthy of the extra trust which is what is important for Adminship anyway. 
support,Unconditionally supporting. 
support,Sure. No reason not give him the mop and shotgun. Uncontroversial quality editor who won't misuse the tools. 
support,Change to User has been active as of lately. 
support,Good editor sensible guy: support. 
support,I made it through this process with 1500 edits at most over the same period of time. 
support,&#8212;
support,he's answering my questions about page deletion...I figure I either have to support him or resign in disgrace. Seriously in my experience he seems very calm intelligent and likely to do well in this role. 
support,Long time contributor good editor. Number of edits is proportional to quality of work prefer better quality over high edit count. [[Special:Contributions/Who|&infin;]]
support,I am persuaded out of neutrality. (And I've moved my previous comments down to the 'comments' section.) 
support,Wholeheartedly look at all he's done... wow...we need this guy!!! Now get ready to swab sailor! SWAB I SAY! 
support,I've seen many good things from him and expect he'd do well with admin tools too. 
support,The romantic in me supports (see below). 
support,excellent contributor. 
support,Impressive articlespace edits and an indication that you will help close out VfD discussions can only be a Good Thing&trade;. 
support,Definitely. He's helped me out on RC patrol and looks like he's highly qualified in the other areas as well. 
support,adminship will be a plus in his already remarkable fight on vandalism.
support,I'm tempted to remind people that this should be no big deal but I know better. So Jareth welcomes new users and has been fortunate enough hitherto in avoiding conflicts. Are those really bad things? From what I see in Jareth's record he has potential to be a great admin and has been here long enough to become a trusted member of the community. . 
support,No big deal and I thought he she was one already anyhow. The guy's gal's offering to do more work for us I say we let him her. There's nothing that indicates that he'll she'll abuse admin tools. But if this nomination fails then please keep up the good work and come again soon we need more admins willing to tackle copyvio backlogs. 
support,Quality edits especially in wikifying and cleanup and vandal patrolling. We need more editors like him. 
support,insane enough to be on [[mail:helpdeskl|helpdeskl]]. Go forth and do good stuff! 
support,In my view the Talk record shows this user has handled a few thorny issues which is a good sign. More community interaction would be desirable but I don't see that as a bar to adminship. 
support,Good editor will be good admin 
support,no reason to believe he will abuse admin tools. 
support,Enthusiastic David Bowie support [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e</i]]>
support,solid record of editing and vandalfighting. Lack of talkpage contributions is a bit unusual but not a nogo issue and explanations seem satisfactory. 
support,Kate's tool is back up. He does have over 3000 if you count the 226 deleted edits. His record is good and shows a lot of work. 
support,due to namespacecountitus in the oppose votes. I don't get many messages on my talk page and most of my talk edits are due to giving standard template messages to vandals. Users talk over the place and can not be measured with edit counters. 
support,Excellent wikifier and vandal fighter from the looks of things. I don't have a problem with comparing namespaces but Talk contributions seem less than relevant for a person who busies himself doing the grunt work others don't have patience for. 
support,Weak Moderately Strong only seen him once and it was good [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]] ([[User talk:Redwolf24|talk]]) 23:42 15 November 2005 (UTC) After remembering where I remember Jareth for I remember that Jareth's been quite likable so support strongly ;) [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,After responding to [[Talk:Cyborg#RfC_on_The_Terminator.28s.29_as_cyborg.2C_as_cited|a rather problematic topic/RfC I posted]] and after I solicited additional assistance regardless of J.'s longevity on Wikipedia I have found Jareth to be very analytical conciliatory [[frolic|pleasant to work with]] and somewhat humorous. Thus I offer my unsolicited support for Jareth's RfAdmin. 
support,The links provided by the anonymous user () opposing below convinced me that Jareth should be an admin. She was calm polite and clear about the relevant policies in that interaction. You certainly don't have to be an admin to cite the blocking policy which constitutes advice not a threat. 
support,Hard worker. A look at his/her contribs shows s/he does a lot of gruntwork. Comments on talk pages are friendly whether they be welcome messages or politely worded requests to stop vandalizing. Always uses edit summary. A good deal of reverting vandalismso the admin tools would be good for this user. 
support,Looks as though this user doesn't allow others to pick a fight with her helps sort out disputes and could use the admin tools to make the project better.
support,mainly based on coolheaded dealings with anon in the oppose column. 
support,Everything looks fine to me...little more interaction. 
support,Despite not having focussed on editing articles in a major way she has put a lot into the Wikipedia project as a whole by cleaning up. Some people are just more made for that. More importantly she's made over 260 replies to the [[mail:helpdeskl]] list an important point of contact for ignorant members of the public and future Wikipedians alike. 
support,Has plenty of helpful interaction with new/potential members of the community on helpdeskl. 
support,My original opposition was due to what I saw as lack of interaction with other users; however now that I see Jareth is quite involved on the helpdeskl I have no problems supporting. 
oppose,Only 31 edits to articletalk pages which shows too little community interaction. 
oppose,Only 31 articletalk page edits??? Community interaction is essential to good adminning. 
oppose,Based on the edit imbalance I feel this user needs more of a record on which to judge his capabilities. "Better safe than sorry vote" and I look forward to supporting later. 
oppose,After only receiving an admin nomination Jareth is acting as if s/he is king of wiki. S/he is presently threatening me with suspension and s/he is not yet an admin. Please read her/his threatening message here: <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:24.55.228.56> I have never broken the 3RR rule despite her/his agressive talk. Make her/him an admin and you will have created a monster. Be warned. 02:19 18 November 2005 (UTC)UPDATE: Jareth wrote that "If either you or 24.55.228.56 continue with the edit wars and reversions today you will be blocked from editing."<http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Francesca_Allan_of_MindFreedomBC&action=edit> Jareth presently has no authority to block anyone. Do you want to give him/her that power?
oppose,Admins must of necessity interact widely with the community. Experience doing so is an indsiputable must and is also very necessary to be able to carefully judge the temperament of a candidate.

support,Seems like a fine user. 
support,I am satisfied with his explanation on his alleged "deletionism". To be a deletionist one must vote delete against the consensus more often than others do. Since 94% of the articles he voted to delete ended up being deleted it means has an excellent understanding of the general consensus and inclusion criteria. We need his help closing AfDsgive him the mop!

I am sure that he will make a fair and balanced admin looking at his communication and editing style and I certainly have no reservations lending my support.

Things you could do include voting here regularly and voting in [[AFD]]s etc. </sup/><p style="fontfamily: Bradley Hand ITC Comic Sans MS;">
support,An infrequent admin is better than none at all. I trust you and you meet .

support,I've seen plenty of evidence of good interaction and judgment. Also see . 
support,Suppoert 
support,I can trust you.
support,Cool. 
support,Obviously a good editor and one that is committed to the idea of wikipedia and has a life outside of it. Who cares if you took a break?
support,good and committed. deserves it if anyone does.
support,you'll do. 
support,classic example of outstanding editing behaviour hiding behind the edit count and edit pattern. If you go through all of this user's edits and diffs (as I have done) you will find that this user is thoroughly conscientious courteous and consistent. Many of his contributions are mature well thought out and extensive. There are hardly any spelling mistakes; I consider this indicative of one who acts with care deliberation and precision. Although there are currently concerns that this user has not contributed to a variety of namespaces I don't think this should necessarily be a concern here. Based on his edit history I am confident that none of the administrative functions will be used by this user unless it is essential to the task at hand whatever that might be. This user also seems to be very well adapted to resolving chronic subtle problems on Wikipedia those which take an exceptional amount of time and effort to see through to completion. Perhaps his interests at the moment are different from what I think of as a stereotypical "front line administrator" (one who deals primarily with RC patrol on a daily basis for example) but sometimes I think we require a diversity of administrative and interpersonal skills on Wikipedia and so I feel he would be a good fit to the community in this regard. 
support,Definitely support. 
support,seems solid 
support,per Michael Snow and HappyCamper. 
support,Good edits good community skills; will make good admin. 
support,Kudos for starting a discussion on your page about link spam and what we need to do about it. Hopefully admin privileges will allow you to drive this more.

support,good user from what I've seen and three month experience is no problem with me. Admin is no big deal.
support,In my experience this editor is reasonable and thoughtful and respectful of consensus. Trustworthy. 
support,per Xoloz he has high standards. 
support,Makes helpful remarks. Good luck! 
support,Strong Im not even gonna say "I thought he was one" its too banal... Oh I just said it.lol. Seriously I think that Jkelly is a great Wikipedian. I also want to say thank you for giving me the feedback on the [[Celine Dion]] peer review. Good luck in your RFA! 
support,No problems here.
support,sounds to good to be true :D 
support,per above good user. 
support,JKelly would make a great Wikipedia administrator He's excellent at conflict resolution staying cool when the editing gets hot and in three months he has attained a better grasp on the principles and policies of Wikipedia than people who have been here threee times as long have. 
support,I feel that Jkelly will make a fine admin. Cheers 
support,Definitely. 
support,looks like an excellent candidate for adminship. 
support,Wait ... he's only been here three months? "Thought he was one". 
support,appears to be a strong contributor.

support,Definite support. Agree with [[User_talk:Jni#Adminship|Fvw's comment]]. 
support,for the reasons fvw gives. 
support,Would like to see more Talk page interaction; however has been here a long time and does a lot of vandalism control. 
support,Cannot oppose user opposed by Dr Zen. No seriously I've seen jni do great work on RC and can we please stop with these trollish pseudovotes and actually judge the people being nominated here on their own merit? 
support,I second fvw's comments and add to it that I like the broad scope of Jni's edits. One TLA supported!

support,He has made quite a variety of contributions to the project and his assistance at the Help Desk demonstrates his knowledge of Wikipedia. The minor edits thing is forgiveable; he now understands how to use them I'm sure. A nice guy in person too. 
support,Radiant's comment below does concern me a little but it also shows that Jnothman learns from mistakes. A dedicated wikipedia should be a fine admin.

support,Has been nothing short of wonderfully supportive and helpful (not to mention the only one to help me) with on categorizing the Hebrew alphabet. Deserves to be an admin and I'm sure will make a great one. 
support,will make a splendid admin I agree. 
support,Super Hyper Magnificent Extreme Superlative ingness!. Agreeing with Nightstallion that RfA is not an endorsement of a user's supposèd flawlessness. I'd rather have admins who can admit they've made a mistake and be willing to improve as jnothman's response to Radiant!'s objection indicates he is than have admins who are incapable of accepting and incorporating honest constructive criticism into their MO. Given jnothman's response I think he fits in well with my view of a perfect candidate: not the personification of perfection but the personification of a desire to keep working toward perfection.

support,(even though he's Jewish and a Sydneysidershock horror!)

support,of course. 
support,RC soldier. 
support,Bovine An excellent vandalism fighter. 
support,Suppport We need more female admins to push my agenda...err...oops...TINC.... Seriously though vandal fighters are exactly the type of admins we need. Editors don't need admin privileges as much as people who work behind the scenes do. And lets not forget that this project wouldn't work if it wasn't for all of us. Even the trolls and vandals are useful. (they keep us on our toes and give us something to laugh about later)

support,Go for it
oppose,far too new infrequent edits. Almost all of his edits are pornography related <http://faleg.org/cgibin/wannabe_kate?username=Joe+Beaudoin+Jr.&site=en.wikipedia.org>.

support,per silly oppose vote. [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,your local vandalwhacker! 
support,"four months is not long enough". Why dont we just make a policy that says we need atleast 2 years experience! 
support,Great vandal figher 4 months is plenty. 
support,per freestylefrappe's oppose. Just kidding. Solid record seems like good match. 
support,I'm wary of this being Yet Another CVUinspired RfA but Johann looks like a top bloke so why not eh? Journalist: ideally we'd want 2 years experience 15k edits at least one edit war over whether or not George Bush became a Muslim and a signed note from the user's mum promising that as far as she's aware he's never kicked puppies. 
support,four months is plenty enough in my books. I have seen some users with half the time on Wikipedia who would be ready for AdministrativePower® almost straight away. 
support,I've seen enough to trust this editor will use admin tools wisely. 
support,would be a great admin.
support,Enthusiastic and shows initiative. 
support,Need more people to fight the invading hordes of vandals.
support,glad to have you! 
support,support 
support,No Big Deal. 
support,Shy cute lesbian support... The only reason I can see not to is the lack of AfD participation but I have no reason to believe that Johann will misuse his powers in that regard. 
support,Appears to have done plenty of good work. I don't find the opposition convincing. 
support,If you succeed then read carefully up on policies before applying admin options. And if you don't succeed then come back in a couple of months 'cause we need more admins and I think you'd do fine 
support,Need more admins. 
support,ThoughtIhadalreadyvotedsupport. 
support,Great user. with extreme prejudice. 
oppose,Weak four months is not long enough. 
oppose,just not been here long enough your on the right track though support if there is a next time. 
oppose,Time is too short and even after multiple edits to your questions they are still not formatted correctly. Reinforces the shortness: you need to learn better editing skills first. 
oppose,Weak Oppose. Although you have 3000odd edits it seems that you're still badly inexperienced policywise. As far as I can tell (by looking at your edits manually) most of your talk pg edits are welcoming other users (not a bad thing but something that inflates the edit count without actually giving you a lot of experience interacting with others). You don't seem to have contributed to AfD discussions at all and from the tone of your answer to question 1 you don't seem to realize that lots of nonadmins can contribute to AfD (and even close consensus keeps after 5 days). Your difficulty formatting your answers implies to me that you simply don't have enough policy understanding to be an effective admin. Your answer to question 3 especially makes me wonder (would you go running to a mediator to solve problems?). This is nothing against you as you seem like a good contributer but I haven't seen your judgement in action enough to know that you'd be a good admin.
oppose,still too soon. 
oppose,My oppose vote is not related to time issues as I have seen editors with less time on WP with an excellent grasp of policy. My concern is one of maturity. From what I have seen this editor as good potential but needs more time in which by participating in the wikipedia namespace he can develop a better sense of the project. 
oppose,I only found about 10 edits in the last 1000 that weren't either a revert a welcome message or related to RFA. Needs a lot more experience of other facets of Wikipedia. 
oppose,per Scimitar and time concerns. "Better safe than sorry" vote and I'll be happy to support after there is more of a record. 
oppose,While the number of edits in so short a time is spectacular what concerns me is the answer to the third question. In my honest opinion until you've actually been "tested in the fires" of Wikipedia be it through even a mild conflict with an editor we have no real way of knowing how you may or may not handle it. (It's really more a lackofexperience thing than anything else sorry) As other Opposes have said once you get a bit more experience under your belt I'll be more than happy to support! Best of luck! 
oppose,Weak Oppose per Scimitar. Editor appears to be well meaning but I have reservations about his current level of experience. 
oppose,due to lack of experience needs more time. 
oppose,per Scimitar and others. 
oppose,Weak oppose I'll commend you on your good work welcoming ppl but your experience in wikipedia is a bit limited. Spend a month or so visiting other parts of wikipedia (see [[Wikipedia:Directory]]) for a guide of places to go) and you'll be a shooin 
support,Supersize support as nominator! 
support,Shauri's description of the candidate and her trust seal it for me.
support,Strongly Personal interaction with Johntex and dozen of common watchlist pages that I see him make great edits to daily make me proud to support his bid for adminship! 
support,without reservations! Beat me to it. &middot;

support,good egg. 
support,Yes. He has enough experience to get the dustbuster. ing.

support,Never met him but has votes from a lot of people I respect including the nominator. 
support,per Evilphoenix. 
support,I think this user would be a great addition to the cabal... 
support,seems civil reasonable and willing. 
support,An excellent editor. 
support,Extremely worthy candidate. 
oppose,This editor has engaged in [[WP:POINT]] disruption in the past (for example VfD'ing pages in retaliation for editing disputes on other articles <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dan_Patrick_%28radio_host%29&diff=14302805&oldid=14302335>). He's currently a party to a merged arbitration case involving myself and several other editors that I initiated in late August against another user. This is notworthy because JohnTex joined the arbitration with a countercomplaint against me last month regarding a dispute we had in late May on the [[Houston Chronicle]] article. I had not encountered JohnTex anywhere else on Wikipedia between May and September when he joined the RfAr nor did he participate any further in the Houston Chronicle article or its subsequent mediation attempts. Thus I consider it fair to question the timing and motive of his involvement in the RfAr given that he was apparently trying to resurrect an old dispute that he had not even participated in for over three months with an editor he had not even encountered for that same period of time. 
support,Since I just offered to nominate him myself I support strongly. Great work on taxonomy and plants. Good editor pleasant person to deal with. 
support,Strongly support. A very helpful wikipedian. 
support,seems like good [[Wikipedia:Wikipedians|Wikipedian]]! | [[User talk:Flcelloguy|Give me a note! ]]</font color>| 
support,communicates well with users does janitorial chores and is a great contributor
support,JoJan is a natural choice for an adminship. He is an everconstant support to new users like myself for whom I would have had a much more diffficult time adjusting to Wikipedia from Academy. JoJan's advice is excellent honest to the point always guiding the new user to better climb that learning curve on Wikipedia. As well JoJan's advice on what a Wikipedia article should be has been a constant beacon of style formate structure etc. He guides patiently the new user to the right outcome. 
support,I've recently put one of JoJan's picture contributions up for [[Wikipedia:Featured picture candidates/Daisy1web|FP]]. He seems to be a very good all round contributor. 
support,Definitely! Over 8000 edits with significant article content and image contributions a prolific and collaborative editor. 
support,Respectful collaborative/consensual and extensive contributor who would use his Adminship powers for the betterment of Wikipedia.[[Image:Flag_of_Australia.svg|15px]] 
support,Hardworking knowledgeable and cooperative contributor 
support,Sure. 
support,Has by gentile persuasion introduced us to new places. Any editor who can do that to my "madeupmind" has a special talent and deserves to be an Admin. And we're not easy to "pull along". 
support,since I nominated after all. ;) 
support,Jondel has a history of good edits and knowledge of Wikipedia procedures. He's also shown a courteous manner with other users (yes I am sufficiently confident in this user to vote before reading his answers). 
support,I'm a little worried about the lack of edit summaries and am also concerned that their may be a tendency to overuse speedy deletion ([[Alan M. Hantman]] was tagged for example) but the good far outways the bad. Thus I support. 
support,Definitely. 
support,Sure 
support,he's been around for a while does good work and stays peaceful. Excellent candidate. 
support,even though the [[child prodigy]] troll sides with him :p Good editor. 
support,Cool. 
support,Better he than me. Hehehe. 
support,shows good characteristics and is worthy of sysop powers. I pesonally enjoyed the acceptance speech but that might be just me. 
support,I'd like him to start using edit summaries but other than that I like him quite well. Plus he's edited a bunch of articles about the Philippines and it's nice on such a big site with so many topics to have editors who are willing to lend a lot of knowledge in specific areas. 
support,Seen him in action and liked what I saw. 
support,I have no qualms over it. 
support,as a nonvandal. He also just seems so very pleasant. It's like a bit of warm sunshine pooling on the floor on a spring day with the scent of lilacs floating in the window on a gentle breeze. 
support,Excellent hardworking editor. Hooray for Jondel. 
support,A level headed editor. 
support,this is one of those "isn't s/he one already?" nominations... I seem to see the name pop up on vandal patrol a lot. 
support,Pretty good guy reverts vandalism but also believes in fun. (Jondel plays in the sandbox regularly with DrZoidberg and Fonzie Fan but doesn't harm the sandbox) 
support,Hell this guy should make a geat administrator 
support,Edits indicate no reason for concern. 
support,No reason he shouldn't have the sacred mop. 
support,My bologna has a first name it's OSCAR. My bologna has a second name its MAYER Oh I like to eat it every day and if you ask me why I'll say... Cause Oscar Mayer has a way with BOLOGNA. Why did I say that? I didn't want to mimic someone else's comment and I didn't want to be commentless.

support,He's not an admin already? 
support,make it so. 
support,I give Joolz my full support. 
support,Just take a look through <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Joolz his contributions> it's quite obvious that he will do a great job of administrating Wikipedia with all this work and experience. 
support,I think Stevey has said it all already. 
support,Thought he was one. 
support,FOR GREAT JUSTICE! (I've seen some of his edits on RC patrol and they are quite good)

support,I haven't had much interaction with Joolz but recently he was remarkably insightful not to mention friendly. He'll make a fine admin. I'd caution slightly that the best decisions are made in the full flux of onwiki discussions rather than on IRC but as an admin on Commons I'm sure he already knows that. 
support,no prob with this one. 
support,with a broom strongly. 
support,It doesn't hurt to give the sysop flag to domain experts and four years meets my time standard ;) 
support,This has got to be a joke he's been here four whole years and still isn't an admin! What? We'll have to do something about that won't we! Strongly support.

support,Excellent work on taxonomy. 
support,An overdue nomination for a fine editor. .

support,I think he has shown himself to be trustworthy. 
support,Normally see you around alot Good Editor 
support,Seen around a lot no probs. 
support,although I think your sig is a little on the garish side. 
support,but please fix your sig. The linebreak it forces is intensely annoying as it disrupts the flow of any discussion it appears in. 
support,definitely admin material but I also hate the spacewasting garish signature.
support,I was one of the only four original supporters so I'll support again since it seems you've only improved since last time. My only criticism is that the your wikipedia namespace edits are mostly limited to AfD... but then so are mine 
support,RfA is supposed to be "no big deal". The person should simply be shown to have the best interest of Wikipedia at heart and be able to work well with others. Journalist meets these criteria far surpasses them and then laps them and then helps them up once they have fallen down from exhaustion. There is no reason Journalist should not get it and scads of reasons to support.

support,I always see this user voting on stuff and making good comments. Will make a good adminstrator.
support,oh my freaking jebus. How didnt i know you were running. 
support,I thought this user was already an admin. Also I know what this user has done so I support. 
support,My previous comment was...Hi Journalist. I noticed this nomination in your last edit of the Mariah Carey records page. I've got a question for you below....And the question has been well answered so I have to say support. 
support,After further veiws of your edits i must say they are quite beautiful so my vote is now to support you 100%

support,Neutral. Gah! I really really want to support and would gladly do so with a few more WP namespace edits. Come on someone twist my arm a bit... 
support,I thought he was one he appears to be experienced and civil. 
support,Of course. No big deal. [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,good flexible and attentive editor. 
support,An excellent new sig by the way. 
support,Definitely!! >: 
support,Absolutely. 
support,Excellent contributor; looks like he'll be up there on . 
support,Since this is such a close vote it may need my support to tip it over the edge. Hand Journalist a mop. 
support,Piling onI mean support. 
support,I interacted little with him but I liked what I read. 
support,And they complain about my pretty question marks [[Special:Contributions/Who|&infin;]]
support,Piling on as well An excellent fellow Journalist has made a wide range of quality contributions to Wikipedia and has behaved with civility and respect to all concerned. I am certain that he will make a good administrator and it is nothing short of a miracle that he is not already one. 
support,and it is with pleasure that with my vote yours is now the 9th most supported RfA ever! Congrats Journalist! [[Image:Smiley.png|14px]] 
support,Of course! 
support,absolutely and without question. 
support,Wow great work on getting so many votes! It's almost like a cult (in a good way). I've not come across Journalist personally but all you have to do is look at his contributions to realise it's an absolute must that he become an admin'! 
support,Need I say more...May the Force be with you! 
support,support he is a good contributor

support,Needs more WP namespace edits. 
support,Neutral this section looked a little bare Its not as if one more support really matters here 
support,I'm the nominator. [[Q.E.D.]] ∎ duh. 
support,Sure. 
support,Diligent reversion of vandalism. 
support,Keen and courteous. A fine combination. 
support,does important work and does it well. 
support,</big>! 
support,support. Give the man a rollback button! 
support,Cool. 
support,[[Image:Flag_of_Australia.svg|15px]] 
support,this one is obvious. Look at all the incredible antivandalism work he's been doing already. 
support,The right nominee for the right reasons. Give the man a mop. 
support,Ride 'em up move it out ROLLBACK! 
support,Would benefit with the rollback tool. 
support,Does a good job of keeping Wikipedia clean. 
support,Record looks good. 
support,a clearandpresent admininwaiting. 
support,Savvy in catching POV language and working reasonably with other editors to remove or substantiate and also seems to make effort to present content in a manner intended to ward off potential POV edit wars. I noticed this on the [[AIDS]] article for example but this style is evident on a broad spectrum of articles. 
support,[[User Talk:Texture|&#964;]]
support,That's hot. 
support,Never heard of him to my memory but maitenance should always be rewarded. 
support,He notice a vandalism using an ATeam reference which makes him automatically cool. 
support,My only contact with Jredmond as I recall is a news article about Wikipedia in which we were both quoted but from that impression alone (and the way he spoke about Wikipedia) it's clear we can trust him with "the keys to the custodian's closet" as would put it. 
support,Has all the admin qualities. 
support,Strongest possible support. A true vandal slayer if ever there was one. 
support,Vandals quake at the sight of a mop and will be put into good use! 
support,A nobrainer: Jredmond has been one of the most impressive vandal fighters around and his responses to the questions below illustrate that he has a given the sort of thought towards sysop protocols that are my greatest concern in adminship votes. 
support,a bit late but I'll add just one more vote as if it was needed! 
support,Absolutely.
support,Mos def. 
support,good choice. 
support,First time I felt I could judge someone's actions enough to vote. Level head excellent adminny goodness. 
support,If he accepts. 
support,Hey NO FAIR! Other folks managed to get in their support ahead of me! 
support,I can think of few more deserving assuming he wants it. 
support,Yay! 
support,Finally. ;) 
support,before he escapes again ! 
support,Strongest possible support. 
support,Absolutely yes. One must be as a newbie to enter the cabalkingdom of Wikip... er I mean JRM is trustworthy diplomatic perceptive and has for a "perennial newbie" an awfully good idea of what Wikipedia's about. 
support,naturally. 
support,Very much so. 
support,of course 
support,naturally 
support,of course. 
support,About time! 
support,JRM is one of the most precise educated and careful of those who work to make Wikipedia a useful and reliable encyclopedia instead of merely a social club. (But remembering someone else's grudge only sustains it.) 
support,You're trapped now. 
support,Of course; he's a great editor. 
support,! 
support,Excellent user. 
support,Just Rocks Me. 
support,Familiar name reliable editor. 
support,Strongest possible support. One of the really good ones who makes this site so much fun! 
support,wow both Bishonen and JRM up for adminship... glad I checked the admin page today 
support,It is a pleasureand to show the proper frame of mind I must say "Because the Queen insists." Do you remember the Duke and the Lady in the white dress in Le Roi de Coeur? 
support,Strongly support. 
support,What more is there to say? 
support,<nowiki>{{subst:thoughthealreadywasone}}</nowiki> 
support,YES!</big> 
support,Strong 
support,Very Strong For among other things for attempting to add some sanity into the discussion at [[Wikipedia talk:Transclusion costs and benefits]] (and [[ Orange (word)]] of course). 
support,a responsible editor I thought he was already an admin 
support,Yes in oranges. 
support,I'll support even if he's too jumpy when someone gets off the A16 at 130! 
support,Fine admin material. 
support,Easy decision. 
support,"$user isn't an admin already?" 
support,And a fine soul it is. . I believe (signature added by 
support,in the strongest possible terms. All the reasons why are already listed. 
support,for being an "antiauthorist" and a "moderate eventualist". We need more . 
support,for all the reasons above. 
support,Really wonderful I read your page twice: like you I also want to remain always like a new wiki. Wish you all the best in advance in your role.
support,of course 
support,No question.
support,Surprised that JRM already isn't an admin. 
support,As with Bishonen's nomination through my own interactions and the opinion of others listed above me I think JRM would make a good administrator. 
support,A quality user all round. 
support,All your base will belong to us 
support,Whole heartely support. 
support,Sure. A little too soon after tha last self nom but you're good overall. 
support,Moo 
support,I felt bad last time when I opposed. You now have a little bit more experience so I support you 100%. Good luck. 
support,seen him around a lot and have interacted with him.[[User_talk:Robchurch|Talk]] | 
support,And happy to do it. 
support,and without reservations now that he's been around longer. Actually as someone who's gone and done things like blocking and deleting after he identified that they needed to be done (and I can't think of a false alarm) give him his own mop already. 
support,A fine vandal fighter. 
support,User is fighting vandalism (in my opinion to well as I can revert as fast as he can). Tagged along in #en.wikipedia.vandalism ;) 
support,Seen him around in #wikipedia on Freenode a lot an EXCELLENT vandal fighter 
support,Sounds good. 
support,For great encyclopedia. 
support,I supported a few weeks ago and I see no reason to change my mind now. 
support,for the same reasons as last time. 
support,Fine vandalhunter. 
support,per same reasons last time 
support,as per last time. 
support,without any kind of reservations. 
support,Oh yeah! 
support,Hand this dude the mop already. 
support,Good user. 
support,I've seen good work and as per Mindspillage. 
support,I've seen nothing but quality edits and enthusiastic vandal fighting. 
support,Absolutely. | [[User_talk:Linuxbeak|Talk]] | 
support,Esoppo A great guy and would make an awesome vandal fighting admin. 
support,I think he knows why I'm supporting him ;) 
support,I opposed last time as the user account was less than 2 months old but another month of experience makes Jtkiefer a reasonable admin candidate. 
support,Full disclosure: Jtkiefer nominated me for my successful adminship candidacy. That said I think his contributions certainly deserve a mop and bucket. 
support,Cool. 
support,Thoughtful & conscientious in my experience. 
support,Jtkiefer is very friendly helpful and courteous at Wikipedia. He has many valuable article contributions and does a really good job being an active part of our online community. of course! 
support,Keep fending off the vandals! [[User_talk:bmicomp|(talk]] 
support,Enough time and edits to have experience with janitorial tasks for that is what adminship is all about. 
support,He's always beating me to reverting vandalism.
support,[[Special:Contributions/Who|∞]]
oppose,[[user:Celestianpower/Adminship|my standards]] don't allow it. Not enough edits to the main namespace for me and therefore not enough experience of actually writing an encyclopedia. Come back when you've got about 600+ articlespace edits and I'll gladly support. [[user:Celestianpower|Cel]]
oppose,Opppose I insist that you still do not have enough exeperience. Nevertheless it seems that your nomination will pass this time. 
oppose,Three months is insufficient. 
support,First one Justinc. 
support,why not? 
support,I don't have editcountitis
support,Oh yeah I support too if that isn't already implied by my nomination. :"> 
support,has been doing good work on food and drink among other things. Has some minor weaknesses on the subleties of Irish beer but he just needs to drink more of it 
support,I don't know this editor but maybe I'm not getting out much would appear to good candidate. 
support,We need more admins working with images. 
support,We do not have enough London admins. We do not have enough East London admins. We do not have enough London images. From what I can see of Justin's oeuvre he's needed. 
support,Cool. 
support,My only reservations is he coming across as an expert on United States fair use doctrine. I don't know his qualifications for telling other Wikipedians what does and what does not qualify as fair use. 
support,Multicellular nominator support. 
support,I have seen this editor around. Good work! 
support,Good work. 
support,this user is unlikely to abuse administrator tools. 
support,seems reliable. [[Image:Flag_of_Europe_and_Austria.svg|20px]] 
support,seems to be a fine addition
support,seems like a trustworthy chap 
support,now with extra protein . 
support,great contributions and is often first to revert vandalism on some articles i have on my watchlist. 
support,give him a mop 
support,Is this what we do to valuable contributors now? Give them a mop? So be it. 
support,I've seen you around doing good work. 
support,Seen this candidate here and there. 
oppose,<del>. AFAIK you don't need admin powers to clean out categories. There is no speedy deletion backlog at all thanks to tag and bag and it doesn't hurt if it takes a couple more days to keep or delete AfDed articles. It's good that you offered to help tackle vandalism on the science articles though. If you intend to actively patrol these articles and not just dump them all on your watchlist I may move my vote to neutral. (If you just watchlist them vandalism will likely slip through most uncaught vandalism would have gone uncaught even if everyone had the rollback feature.) 
support,Funny thing I was thinking of nominating him today but it somehow slipped my mind and he beat me with a selfnomination... JYolkowski would make a great admin. He has been relentlessly reverting vandals (see his user contributions) and is extremely dedicated to Wikipedia. In addition he is polite and professional. He has also been involved in a meticulous picture tagging project. Finally he has welcomed a lot of new users (including me!) Thus I am honored to give the first vote of support to JYolkowski. 
support,Sure. I haven't run into him personaly but he seems like good sysop material. 
support,Vandal hunter? That's my type of guy! | 
support,Excellent user. 
support,I've had nothing but good experience with J and he always explains his actions to the community the most important quality in an admin in my view. 
support,Decent experience with this user. 
support,I've seen him on the RC Patrol he deserves the extra tools. 
support,A great editor (see his FA work at [[Canadian Pacific Railway]]) who has now turned his attention also to battling vandalism. 
support,I've seen this user revert lots of vandals the rollback button will serve him (?) well. 
support,Edits show a strong dedication to RC patrol and a worthy admin candidate. 
support,Why yes. Good editor interested in mopping and bucketing interacts well and a selfnom my favorite icing on the cake? Of course! 
support,I usually disagree with selfnominations but Yolkowski is a good and levelheaded contributor and so deserves an exception. 
support,Excellent user and valuable contributor. Will make a fine admin. 
support,As others stated above he is polite and professional and he explains his edits. Furthermore he has contributed to controversial talk pages without getting rattled. 
support,As the nominator full support. 
support,K1Bond007 is one of the most reliable contributors I've worked with. 
support,on condition he promises to James Bond judo chop all those nasty vandals. 
support,does a lot of work participates in VfD shows experience suitable for administrator. <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&target=K1Bond007&offset=0&limit=250> 
support,The little I know of K1Bond007 is enough to know that he is worthy of administratorship and the little time I have spent on Wikipedia enough to notice his contributions (especially in [[Wikipedia:WikiProject_Computer_and_video_games|WikiProject Computer and video games]]) &#151; and hereby laud them. 
support,Strong I have nothing bad to say about K1Bond007. Definately deserves adminship. 
support,It's really high time that James gets promoted to administrator. He's gained a lot of experience and has done very much for Wikipedia.
support,I briefly interacted with K1Bond007 several months ago when I was working on some of the James Bond articles. Was knowlegable and courteous then as he is now. 
support,I've also interacted with K1Bond007 over James Bond articles very fair and accommodating. Contribution to this subject immense. 
support,Does good work. 
support,I've seen him around video game articles; he does great work on them. 
support,Looking at his contributions he already seems to act like a good administrator. But since he isn't officially an admin at this time I think we should change that. So I will support. 
support,I'm not basing this vote purely on edit count of course... but.... wow. Just wow. 
support,Three in a row ah it's one of those days isn't it? 
support,Good well rounded editor with great NPOV. [[Special:Contributions/Who|&infin;]]
support,Why not?
support,A great help on CfD. 
support,I wondered why he wasn't one already. 
support,have seen good work at [[America's Army]] and other video game related articles over a long period of time. 
support,Experienced.May the Force be with you! 
support,I've had good interactions with this editor and have seen him pounce on problems quickly efficiently and effectively. 
support,Another more than deserving candidate. 
support,just go through his contributions list and you can see highquality edits. 
oppose,part of an ingroup so be wary of a POV abuse of powers. 
support,Theres a mop in my toolshed with your name on it. The pay's not good and the kid's may throw things at you but you'll find it rewarding ;) 
support,Made a good effort to forge a [[Wikipedia:Eras/Compromise proposal/Voting|compromise]] on era styles. 
support,Kaldari. 
support,Cool. 
support,You're gettin' the green light from me pal. 
support,I support for many reasons not the least of which is that I'm often driven to a support vote by reading the reasons that gives for neutral or oppose votes. But more importantly not a vandal and a nom from Mike Snow doesn't hurt either. 
support,No question. He's a good dedicated editor and he'll make a responsible admin. 
support,nice tweaking of the Marshall Texas article series among other things. 
support,Yea. 
support,I see no reason not to. Asking somebody for a nomination in the open is nothing to be ashamed of. Asking by means of email and other personal means that is something to be ashamed of but that's definitely not the case here. 
support,I have no reason not to now. 
support,Well he doesnt meet my minimum standards of having 100000 edits 35 featured articles 6.3 years experience and be a personal friend of jimbo wales. but what the heck. . 
support,Sure. 
support,Will make a valuable administrator. 
support,I've seen that this editor has a levelhead and can be trusted with authority. 
support,See no cause for concern. 
support,I regularly come across Kaldari's edits and he is a valuable contributor and a reasonable voice in controversial discussions. 
support,All looks good. 
support,All does indeed look good. 
support,as nominator. 
support,There's a flurry of good candidates lately

support,As I later read all the answers to the questions below I see that Karmafist regrets our encounter in the George W Bush article...as do I. At that time we were both relatively new here and politics got in the way of our mutual desire to build a better article. I'll take this opportunity to apologize for anything I may have said to force Karmafist to not edit the Bush article and to wish him well in what appears to be an almost absolute concensus in favor of adminship.

support,She is great at keeping her cool and helping to reach consensus in difficult situations. Both the quality and quantity of her work here is excellent. As a matter of openness please note that I am a party to the arbitration concerning Rangerdude. 
support,An excellent editor. 
support,I have only a good experience with her. She will be a great addition to the adminsteam. 
support,Good edit count has experience in several namespaces and is [[m:Association of Deletionist Wikipedians|a deletionist]] to boot!

support,an excellent user. If this is as gadfium says just a pileon it's one of the few I'm happy to add to. 
support,Katefan has exemplary patience with troublesome users. A model for us all. 
support,Because every time I see someone so well endorsed by the WikiCommunity and even if I don't know them I know that they are doing something right. 
support,Without reservation. 
support,Thought admin etc. 
support,with the usual cliche. Katefan0 has shown a remarkable degree of patience in dealing with some of our more vexatious editors. 
support,I've watched from the sidelines and have observed conduct herself w/ diplomacy and levelheadedness on several article disputes. I think she will make a great admin. 
support,would make a great admin. | [[User talk:Flcelloguy|A note? ]]</font color>| 
support,Double triple myGodyoudidn'ttellmeyouwereupforavote Katefan0 has shown herself to be a levelheaded calm person even in heated disputes. 
support,We need more female admins and I say this with utmost respect. Too much testosterone in WP IMO. . 
support,Way way overdue for adminship. 
oppose,Your contributions to [[Texas Rangers Division]] are copyright violations. I don't want that kind of behavior from an admin. 
support,(pending acceptance) Hard working does lots of mopandbucket tasks. Since the user does so many management tasks at CfD it would probably be beneficial to have the ability to delete the cats as well. 
support,I trust Radiant's call on this editor and concur with his judgement. 
support,I mistrust Radiant's call on this editor and I do not concur with his judgement. And that he didn't even cast his vote in support of his own nominee is the greatest insult(!). Which is why I oppose this nominations. Therefore I support. 
support,He once tried to mediate and yeah is that required of someone who has already volunteered to do all the CFD by himself?. Amusing he isnt an admin yet! :D 
support,Looks good. 
support,Absolutely! A stubsorter is my type of person ;) | [[User_talk:Linuxbeak|Talk]] | 
support,Anyone insane enough to slog through WP:CFD deserves to be burdened with adminship. 
support,mop and bucket and all that 
support,I remember lot of useful work. 
support,does all the hard work which is made easier by adminship. 
support,More deletionist than I'd like but at least thoughtful about it. Fine editor everywhere else 
support,Great user. 
support,User is an active contributer and would make a grea admin here at the Wikipedia. 
support,yup. 
support,As someone who has experienced both agreements and disagreements with him I know that he can handle the responsibility maturely. And he's a workaholic on here. 
support,I hesitated at first for three reasons: (1) I didn&#8217;t know him enough to be sure he met my main criterion of conflict resolution. He could have handled one or two cases more calmly <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Kbdank71#Battles_in...> <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Kbdank71#Coast_.26_countryside_cats> but I now realize that these were exceptions. (2) Politically he&#8217;s too far on the deletionist side for me. (3) I mistrusted Radiant!&#8217;s nomination. I feel more comfortable about the latter point since Radiant! didn&#8217;t vote himself. The first two points hint to [[George Washington]]&#8217;s flaws: He&#8217;s very dedicated and gets things done in an area (categories) that sometimes needs a strong hand. When it comes to holding a mop he&#8217;s certainly the right candidate. He readily picks up the dirt others (including me) leave behind.<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Kbdank71#Renaming_categories>. 
support,Most definitely. 
support,Edit history indicates responsible adminship. 
support,good worker on CfD et al.. 
oppose,too deletionist on categories even eliminating ones that are useful. 
support,looks solid enough. [[Image:Flag of Austria.svg|15px]] 
support,Ah the joy of a wellqualified selfnom! Everything looks wonderful. Hardly any experience of controversies but I doubt that would change with adminship. 
support,another good one signs up for extra duty! 
support,Obvious 
support,as per . 
support,good editor 
support,Seems like a good wellrounded editor and no real reason to oppose him. 
support,Extremely Obvious 
support,well duh! [[user:Celestianpower|Cel]][[WP:ESP|e]]
support,Solid record wellqualified for admin post. 
support,unlikely to abuse the administrator toolbox. 
support,Great contributions. Nice images. Asset to wikipedia. 
support,Edit history does not indicate any reason for concern. 
support,Cool. 7000 edits is good enough for me. 
support,Surely not all 400 current admins know how to [[Wikipedia:Deletion process|clean up VfD]] why is it suddenly a requirement for future admins? 
support,does not meet my opposing criteria. 
support,Meets 
support,Strongest possible support. Absolutely cool levelheaded & scrupulously neutral. Adept at brokering compromises. One of the finest wikipedians I have encountered. 
support,Very much support. I'm disturbed to see voters opposing the elevation of editors because they don't edit in the Wikipedia namespace. Why are we asking to punish editors who spend their time constructing an encyclopaedia instead of politicking?
support,need more like him. 
oppose,Even though a number of people disagreed with me in [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Biekko|a previous RFA vote]] I will basically repeat what I said here: does not have enough experience on the janitorial tasks such as VfD TfD CfD etc. These janitorial tasks are an integral part at being an admin. 
oppose,Clearly an excellent user and a valuable contributor but according to Korath's summary of edits he has only 73 edits to the Wikipedia namespace and that is a bit thin for an administrator. If he logs more good edits with those pages I will switch from oppose to clear support. 
support,Major Milkshake 
support,this fine user. [[user:Celestianpower|Cel]][[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]

support,YMHWOA? ! 
support,always assumed he was already an admin since he has been an amazing editor and more than deserves and needs the extra tools that come with adminship. 
support,"thought $user already was an admin" 
support,Strong OI! You've been reading RFA Talk haven't you? You mean you haven't? Oh in that case um anyway you got an automatic pass from me see if you can detective out why on your own! Have a nice day! 
support,Yes absolutely. 
support,We need more admins to Exterminate! the vandals. 
support,anyone who's involved in wading through copyright mess gets my vote.
support,Great editor. 
support,Great contributor especially dealing with [[Wikipedia:Possibly unfree images]]. 
support,All glory to the IRC cabal. 
support,Falls into the "thought he was already" category. 
support,per nominator. [[Special:Contributions/Who|∞]]
support,per nominator.
support,Cool. 
support,Of course. 
support,Glorious eggplant support. Without question. An utterly sensible and highly valuable contributor as well as a sensible and rational mind (an increasing rarity these days). 
support,Extreme lesbian support Until I saw this RFA the other day i thought he was an admin! Anyway would make a nice specimen for our collection! 
support,Thought he was one. 
support,I don't really know this guy but based on the glowing supports others made I guess why the fuck not. 
support,for the comment below questions if for nothing else. 
support,Adminship should be no big deal but even if it was he still more than deserves it. 
support,Unconditional support. 
support,Kmccoy is a responsible and sensible participant and Wikipedia would be well served by enabling his participation as much as possible. 
support,excellent contributor. 
support,Has brain. Have interacted. Trust him to respond to mistakes. 18:23 30 July 2005 (UTC) I am invalidating all of my votes. See my user page for the reasons.
support,responsible sensible edits. Also great work in achieving consensus in many articles. 
support,! [[User_talk:bmicomp|(talk]] 
support,Frog. 
support,That's lukewarm...lukewarm enough for me to support. 
support,wholeheartedly. (and particularly so for ignoring the useless questions template). 
support,Enthusiastic and helpful. Safe bet that he will be an excellent admin and bring honor to the mop. 
support,Absolutely! He's done great work at [[WP:PUI]] and most of the time I feel I'm the only admin cleaning the thing up. Vive la delete button and I'm sure Kmccoy will put it to good use 
support,absolutely without reservation. An firstclass Wikipedian both on the wiki and on IRC; a friendly and helpful individual who is prepared to discuss matters of contention amicably and politely (most notably with myself and Snowspinner over IRC channel policies) which is an increasingly rare quality. Has a good logical mind which is something that is always desirable for an admin. I look forward to seeing this user in action as an admin. 
support,Yeah. 
support,Meticulous image copyright checker.
support,Reasons as above. Wikipedia needs this sort of attention to our copyright issues. Recall good interactions also. 
support,Valuable work on copyright issues no indication admin powers will be abused. 
support,very friendly very helpful; excellent admin material. 
oppose,very weak oppose. I have only recently had any interatcion with Kmccoy and that isn't enough for me to form a reliable opinion either way so normally I wouldn't vote. However the answers to the questions trouble me slightly not because I disagree that adminship should be a big deal but because imho a major qualification for being an admin is about how you deal with your mistakes because everybody makes them. The key things are that you should be prepared to admit to your mistakes and be prepared to explain them if this would help but moreso you should be able to learn from your mistakes. While I see from the contribution history that Kmccoy isn't a vandal the answers don't give me the feeling that they will be prepared to explain and justify their admin actions and to accept they could have handled something in a different way if the situation doesn't work out how they expected. I will consider changing this vote if the response gives me a better feeling. 
oppose,Seems like a great contributor but refusal to answer the questions leaves me uncomfortable. 
support,I was waiting for this user to be listed here. 
support,Of course. 
support,most welcome! 
support,Sure. 
support,Seems like a constructive and reasonable editor. 
support,Yep. – 
support,You betcha.

support,<nowiki>{{USERNAME}}</nowiki> isn't an admin? ;) 
support,Good work. 
support,A thoughtful and careful editor should make a good admin. 
support,I realise I rarely vote to support. I guess I think that there are usually plenty who will. But this is exactly the kind of editor who should be an admin.
support,for outstanding energy and patience. 
support,Fine and excellent.

support,of course. 
support,Of course support. Fellow vandalbuster give him the mop.

Take a look at how personable this edit is: <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Journalist&diff=prev&oldid=28002552>. What's even more amazing is this a  to practice AfD processing! If you ask me this user is more than ready to use those extra buttons.

support,unlikely to abuse admin tools.

support,per cliché. 
support,WE NEED MORE ADMINS ON NEWPAGE PATROL.
support,[[Know thyself]] :>
support,even if he is impersonating me. (joke) 
support,Certainly. 
support,A great asset to the community.
support,certainly. I don't have any doubts this user is prepared for adminship and all interaction I've had with him has been civil. I am very certain that he'll know what to do or ask for help when necessary. [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|xd</span]]>([[User_talk:Titoxd|?!?]] 
support,Strong KoS is absolutely qualified for this position I only expect more good things. [[Image:Pentacle_1.svg|20px]]
support,everything I've seen is good. 
support,enough edits and has been here for a long time. 
support,Kwamikagami is a great editor and thoroughly deserves adminship. [[User:JonMoore| 
support,support good phonetics phonology extra. 
support,I find the lack of wikipediaspace edits refreshing. 
support,Yes please. 
support,better 4 sensible edits than 40 just for the sake of an edit count. 
support,Concur with Tony Sidaway. With regards to the statement Hoary pointed out I trust you understand that as an admin you can't delete the Khoisan language article simply because you want to. 
support,Curiously few Wikipedia namespace edits. 
support,concur with Tony. [[user:Celestianpower|Cel]][[WP:ESP|e]]
support,I'm not sure about the « lack of Wikipedia namespace edits »; by that argument I would probably not have obtained my own adminship. I get the feeling his heart and mind are in the right places though. 
support,support what the hell opposers here is somebody who is into assuring that there is something to protect on Wikipedia and doesn't spend all his time bitching on WP: pages writes great articles without stirring up one dispute that would force him to WP: space what more do you want? You can get a million WP: edits by adding useless comments to every entry on WP:AN or WP:VP what's the merit in that? 
support,support Kwami's contributions are notedly diligent and conscientious and in my experience he has many times demonstrated an innate respect for consensus and fairness and an ability to get on with other editors all needed qualities for an admin. That these qualities have come through without recourse to WP namespace edits is actually a plus as far as I'm concerned.
support,Sure. 
support,has done excellent and muchneeded work. 
support,Yes but more Wikipedia edits needed. [[WP:ESP|e]]
support,support: adminship is not useful exclusively for the Wikipedia namespace. 
support,A long history of good edits and helpful participation on talk pages says far more about ability to be an admin than a few hundred oneline grunts on AfD. Even if a lack of experience with Wikipediaspace pages proves to be a problem any mistakes made can easily be fixed with the right attitude; and Kwamikagami definitely has that. 
support,Remember folks even those that don't waste time in the WP: namespace can make effective use of adminship. 
support,for our constructive collaboration on [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]]related articles. 
support,(insert comment here) 
support,and damn the editcountitis. Just because a user may not utilize the AFD pages etc. doesn't mean that he doesn't need the rollback tool. 
support,He has contributed a lot to language articles and he seems to know his stuff. 
support,Could probably use the extra buttons. Good luck! 
support,Seems clear to me that he would be a good admin just hope we don't lose an excellent editor in the process. 
support,I don't think a lack of edits in the Wikipedianamespace disqualifies; to the contrary I think it is refreshing to have admins who focus on contributing quality stuff (we shouldn't forget that that is one of the best ways to resolve disputes and dissolve vandalism). I'm sure Kwami will put his powers to good use. 
support,I couldn't care less that he doesn't have many WP edits he's a solid good editor and will be of help to Wikipedia. WP edits are dead God save articlespace. 
support,I have seen plenty of activity on various talkpages so I don't think lack of experience in interacting with others in the Wikipedia namespace is a big problem. Has done plenty of excellent work so I support. 
support,The purpose of Wikipedia is to create an encyclopedia and only the main namespace directly serves that end. I agree that it is important for an administrator to demonstrate a wide spectrum of interaction from Kawamikagami's talk page edits we see a greatever involvement than article gnoming. We need administrators from all parts of the spectrum of positive interaction not everyone has to be a wikipolitican editing primarily outside of the main namespace. 
support,Cool. 
oppose,While this user is not a bad user. Actually a very good editor there just aren't enough Wikipedia space edits. Only 5. 
oppose,Its only 4 if you minus the acception on this page. 
oppose,Oppose without prejudice Lack of wiki namespace edits makes me question this editors familiarity with policy and procedure — I will be happy to reconsider later. 
oppose,I'm not much for editcountitis but his presence in Wikispace is practically nil. But keep up the good work! 
oppose,for the reasons given above. 
oppose,Per Jobe6. 
oppose,As per above. Do some work on AfDs join some WP discussions. Show us that you care not only for good articles (as you certainly do) but for WP as a project as well and I will support.

support,have seen this editor about the place I believe will used the mop wisely. 
support,Good levelheaded editor. 
support,Have had great interaction with this editor and definitely helps with the necessary cleanup!! >: 
support,Ran into Kevin a few times in his drive to add [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] links to WP: struck me as a careful and disciplined editor should be a good admin 
support,I second Pete Hurd's sentiments. 
support,I was actually thinking of editors that should be nominated for Adminship and Slac was among them. From what I have seen of his work I am greatly impressed and I think it's safe to say that he can be trusted wholeheartedly with Admin abilities.
support,Responsible editor that I've had good interactions with. Give this man a mop!!!! 
support,obviously 
support,Solid dedicated editor. 
support,Of course! 
support,Excellent contributor and I am surprised this editor was not one already. 
support,I will support. 
support,I'm proud to say that this is my first "thought he already was one" vote. I see 'Slac' all the time and never realized that that wasn't your real username. :P 
support,prolific article space editor. 
support,Happy to 
support,very good contributor of articles and edits. 
support,great deal of edits it'll be good to have an admin capable of doing something other than procedural stuff 
support,The usual "thought he already was one" business. Also I'd be inclined to think anyone who can make it all the way through Infinite Jest has both the patience and the ability to make sense of longrunning complex situations and drawnout fragmented discussions beneficial to an admin. ;) 
support,on the condition that we get to know why Lacrimosus is abbreviated as Slac. Seriously though good contributor to VfD.— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by

support,bien sur.

support,worked well through a difficult problem and is continuing to help. 
support,Extreme Proven performance in battle. Conscientiously maintains civility and due processe while persistently progressing a dialogue to achieve a good article/neutral point.

support,He's an excellent contributor and very dedicated guy who will surely make a great admin! 
support,Looks good based on reviewing Leithp's edit history and a bunch of diffs. 
support,looks good. 
support,BIG BAGPIPE HEAPED WITH HAGGIS SUPPORT. But the nominator has failed to mention the candidate is also coauthor of the (hopefully soontobe) Featured Article on General Sir [[Richard O'Connor]]. Without his encouragement help strategically placed edits and sage advice I would never have had the courage or confidence to BE BOLD and put it forward. He is a great contributor colleague and friend he will make a great addition to the Cabal as well.
support,Contributions appear solid.
support,unlikely to abuse admin tools. 
support,Seems to be a good editor and good candidate for admin 
support,very good user 
support,He has done some great contributing to wikipedia. After reviewing his contributions it looks like he would be a great admin for wikipedia.
support,a scottish soldier to fight the hordes of vandals threatening our fort! 
support,Of course. 
support,good candidate. 
support,looks like the perfect candidate for adminship. 
support,I would like slightly longer answers to the questions below but he sounds like a good editor. 
support,Well yeah of course. 
support,Good contributor. 
support,Clear support. [[Image:Flag_of_Europe_and_Austria.svg|20px]] 
support,Loving the self noms and lack of knee jerkl opposition to them.
support,everything looks to be in order here. 
support,seems a well balanced user. I see no reason not to support. 
support,We can always use vandal fighters. 
support,[[Wikipedia:Esperanza|ε]]
support,100 percent of course 
support,Go linux 
support,This user is always there trying to solve disputes and trying to deal with vandals. A good user who i'm sure would be a great admin. 
support,Very helpful with advice and with help with vandalsism 
support,Does well on janitorial stuff the hard way; I see no reason not to make the job a bit easier 
support,how can you not love this guy? 
support,From memory I think we have crossed swords once or twice the past but that doesn't stand in the way of me recognising Linuxbeak's abilities. 
support,The candidate has already produced a FA that's a labor of love in every sense and has matured impressively as a wikipedian. I asked him about the newbie mistakes he'd made in the conflict with jmabel and his response convinced me he'll be a better admin for making them. Conflict experience is good not bad; I always feel a little unhappy about voting where the candidate simply hasn't had any taste of wikistress. Linuxbeak deals well with it. 
support,100% He is well mannered and a very nice level headed person. His dedicatioon and contributions demonstrate that he has the makings of a great administrator. The guy already has a featured article under his belt. He is an asset to Wikipedia. 
support,Has shown himself to be a diligent and enthusiastic contributor well able to work collaboratively with others and learn from mistakes. (Also anyone that excited about grunt work like stub sorting needs a mop and bucket before he gets his sanity back.) 
support,Cool. 
support,Great user very strong candidate. 
support,a deserving canditate. 
support,SUPPORT 
support,=
support,Meets my 
support,Thought I'd voted already. of course. 
support,"Be bold in editing". That's what I've seen Linuxbeak do while doing RC patrol and new articles patrol. 
support,of course! 
support,I too remember the Jmabel incident and I'm particulary impressed by his willingness to admit he was wrong (<http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AJmabel&diff=14233793&oldid=14175465>); this shows character. He's likely to be an excellent admin and I also admire his extraordinary dedication to the project. 
support,For actions above and beyond the call of duty. 
support,I couldn't find my vote on here...I thought I had already voted! 
support,Of course. 
support,Hard work is its own reward. ;) 
support,Many of the opposition notes below are ridiculous like accusing him of padding his edit count just because he did some minor (but useful) cleanup edits. Other than that he did get into a few "messes" but they weren't always really his fault and I think he got through them OK. 
support,seems like a quality user and the opposition due to the CAP blanking is IMO ridiculous unfair. 
support,This user seems conscientious and mature. 
support,Yay! Finally a likeable moderator... *ahem* a moderator for the PEOPLE! Yay! 
oppose,Looks like between 1000 and 1500 of his 2500 edits are stub sorting but what really sinks this for me is that he puts speedy tags on things that aren't speedies. Just a cursory look turns up these speedy tagged articles that weren't deleted: <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bullet_in_the_Head&diff=prev&oldid=13527216> <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=KoGal&diff=prev&oldid=13527724> <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rice_king&diff=prev&oldid=13500974> <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Basel_Sinfonietta&diff=prev&oldid=13401301> <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joseph_Smith%2C_Jr./Infobox&diff=prev&oldid=12920210> <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chontaduro&diff=prev&oldid=13401330>. I won't comment on <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Civil_Air_Patrol&diff=prev&oldid=14083644 this> which was related to some sort of legal trouble. Breadth of contributions outside of stub sorting seems good. 
oppose,I inherently don't trust accounts which seem to have 1) <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&limit=500&offset=2500&hideminor=0&namespace=&target=Linuxbeak made a few edits then quickly starts voting on deletions> and 2) seems to be "stuffing" their edit counts with menial tasks like stub marking. This user started editing on March 13 and showed from the start a strange familiarity with Wikipedia processes. Can't vote support unless we have a [[Wikipedia:Requests for deadminship|acceptable method]] for removing adminship in case this is a mistake. I encourage others to reconsider this nomination in a couple months. 
oppose,The edits that CryptoDerk has highlighted are way too recent. Only two weeks ago he page deleted an article based on some rubbish about it not being approved by the subject and his own personal commandant? 
oppose,alas. I agree with all those voting support that Linuxbeak has been doing some wonderful work however the very incorrect speedy marking doesn't inspire trust that the deletion feature will only be used in accordance with [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion]]. The CAP thing is a smaller issue to me though it wasn't handled perfectly either. 
support,Looks good.
support,Didn't find anything to object. I hope you will also visit VfD ViP etc from time to time. 
support,Definitely. 
support,Excellent user based on personal interactions. 
support,Cool. 
support,I'm not sure what Carnildo is talking about here but from what I've seen support. 
support,casual sysops needed. 
support,Main page/ITN editing is a good reason for granting adminship you don't need to be a VfD addict or have FAs under your belt you just need to be trusted not to wreck the Main page (and not to indulge in deletion/protection/blocking wars). 
support,A look at the articles on his user page shows very nice work (props for writing an article on the Ford Nucleon!). No reason not to support. 
support,Looks good
oppose,Does not meet 
oppose,Oppose. I would like to see another month or two of service. 
support,Unquestionably without a doubt. 
support,Strong Given that you are a trusted polite and hardworking Wikipedian I'm shocked you're not an Admin already. 
support,That's a LOT of edits and I'm beginning to trust Essjay's decisions. Good luck admining. 
support,have seen the user once or twice and I already trust Essjay's decisions. 
support,Brilliant RC Patroller. 
support,A reliable person. Wonder why she isn't nominated before.
support,He's not already? 
support,I am surprised it has taken this long for him to be nominated. Very good editor. 
support,of course. 
support,Strong He has over 12000 edits in just over 9 months; he's very experienced with User talk and WP: namespaces but still very involved with articles; he seems like a great user; and I thought he was an admin already. 
support,under I thought the user was an admin already argument =). 
support,Unconditional support. 
support,500%. This user is the only user who I see welcoming people as much as (or more than!) myself and there is no better job than helping out the newbies. 
support,| [[User talk:Flcelloguy|A note? ]]</font color>| 
support,Holy crap that's a lot of edits! Have seen good contributions from you on VfD. 
support,Strong A very dedicated Wikipedian who deserves adminship 
support,a nobrainer. Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by 
support,it's high time this user became an admin... 
support,is widely active on WIkipedia.
support,I like Australian crime articles. 
support,You've done all the right things. You definitely deserve this. 
support,very active and definately deserves adminship.
support,Yet another I thought he already was an admin! vote. Serial welcomer oodles of edits an all around great editor. 
support,I have to go with the "What! You mean he isn't already one?" response here! 
support,Cool. 
support,I thought you were one! 
support,Obviously qualified. 
support,Very active doing RC and would benefit with the admin tools. 
support,Good RC. I believe Longhair is cut out for the job!
support,Highly qualified. 
support,Definitely. 
support,active and well qualified. 
support,Strong May the Force be with you! 
support,I was going to go neutral just to bring some variety to this vote but what the hey. If both Denelson and EssJay agree on this so closely following their tiff that's good enough for me.
support,Definitely. 
support,without a second thought. 
support,Enthusiastic support! for a great editor. 
support,Strong 
support,even though over 10% of his edits seem to be on his own user page
support,Over 1700 article space edits including creation of many new articles. Decent participation in other areas as well. Please continue to use edit summaries. 
support,Very good work on Wikiproject:Battles amazing work on Japanese history!
support,[[Soup|]] 
support,from Japanese history lover. 
support,from another Japan Fan. 
support,Excellent work in articles related to Japan
support,Referenced and intelligent coverage of a number of Japanrelated topics; great creation of new articles. 
support,No big deal. Sounds evil enough. We need to build the House of Lords. [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,Good quality edits particularly on Japan. See no reason for concern. 
support,Count me in! 
support,for the reasons detailed in the nomination. 
support,I'm impressed with Lucky's writing. I'm impressed with the way he's addressed the issues that came up in his previous nominations. Most of all I'm REALLY impressed with the way he has taken some difficult editors under his wing in an attempt to move them from nearvandals to productive editors. 
support,I was actually gonna nominate Lucky. 
support,I've been very impressed by Lucky in particular his dealing with difficult newbies and I would have nominated him long ago but gained the understanding he didn't want adminship because of his experience in previous nominations. I'm glad he's finally willing to try again.
support,Active doing RC patrol and has contributed to a number of featured articles. 
support,and about time too: a good editor a fine hand at dealing with vandals clueless newbies and suchlike people and has evident enthusiasm and good humor. 
support,One of the hard workers one of the careful. He cares immensely about the well being of the project. Given how some folks have shown themselves willing to unilaterally block VfD (or delete it) or form "clubs" in name space to achieve their goals havinig someone who has the experience and the proven dedication to following the policies and giving a fig about how well things operate would be a revolutionary change in adminning. 
support,very happy indeed to see this nomination here again. One of the best of all possible candidates. 
support,An impressive contributor. I too was considering nominating him. 
support,Another no brainer (erm my vote that is not Lucky 6.9!) 
support,Unequivocal . For those concerned about his...colorful remarks to vandals I believe the extraordinary amount of patience and kindness shown during /'s [[Wikipedia:Requests for comment/SamuraiClinton|RfC]] and his subsequent mentorship of him more than make up for that. 
support,Good RC work. 
support,Meets my unwritten policies 
support,thought he already was one. 
support,Happy to support. 
support,Very experienced and committed editor should have been made an administrator long ago. The criticisms of his "overzealous" attitude to speedies apply to many existing admins and I recognise that this is a symptom of RC patrollers and not adequate grounds for withholding the mop and bucket (one of our best administrators RickK sadly departed faced similar accusations). 
support,Thought he was one. 
support,Strong 
support,Well experienced user who has matured. 
support,I'm impressed with his improvement and think he's a great candidate. 
support,Longtime editor with solid record. 
support,This is one of those "isn't s/he one already?" nominations... While not a perfect editor occacional mistakes are acceptable. 
support,As cliché as this may sound I thought he was one already. 
support,Just give him the admin hat and be done with it! 
support,I also thought he was one already. Just in the last couple days I've noticed his extreme patience trying to help a problematic new user ([[User talk:Maoririder]]) and was quite impressed. 
support,A fine long term editor. The reasons for oppose are minor. 
support,have good experiences with this editor. 
support,I often see Lucky do a lot of chores that Wikipedia really needs. Also very helpful on the VfD and copyvio checks. 
support,Everything I've seen of Lucky has been positive. 
support,Absolute support. When / first arrived his [[Wikipedia:Requests for comment/SamuraiClinton|unusual editing habits]] annoyed and alienated a number of Wikipedians. But instead of labeling him a troll Lucky showed immense dedication patience and hard work helping him become a better editor. His valuable work welcoming newbies who get off to a rough start continues with . 
support,as per the nomination also I don't think there is an reason to distrust his judgement on deletion.
support,! A solid contributor on more fronts than I can count. 
support,Lucky has been a good editor for a long time and he has a lot of heavy hitters in his corner. Good guy. 
support,I hope that Lucky 6.9 takes note of the some of the criticism however and is very careful with image deletion especially (since it cannot be undone). Better to always tag and let someone else give a second opinion I'd suggest. 
support,He's a great editor and a delightful human being. 
support,as per nominator. Hardworking Wikipedian devoted to cleanup. 
support,per reasons above. 
support,Lucky can be erratic and a bit touchy...not meaning to offend; those are just characteristics that stand out about him and might not be particularly compatible with adminship. But nevertheless I support. He's been through a whole bunch of nominations now and I figure it's time we finally gave it to him. 
support,Keep. I rarely vote at RFAmost of the potential admins I would support don't need my vote. This is an editor who does very good edits and can be very patient with those who need it. I definately trust that he will do well handling his new mopandbucket tasks. 
support,Very strong support nuff said 
support,Wikipedia is better because of you. While it would be nice to have infallible saints as admins it is people like Lucky6.9 who keep it from sinking down due to vandals and trolls. I am very impressed by your work. (What I do not like that you often ignore edit summaries. This makes life of people on RC hard.) 
support,Lucky has done good underappreciated work in all the times I've seen him since we first came across each other. 
support,Strong 
support,It doesn't get any hotter than this. 
support,When I first talked to Lucky a few months ago I already thought he was an admin. 
support,Strong I like this guy he kind of reminds me of me. People don't seem to realize that at first he may have had an atitude but with time melowed down. Good luck! 
support,I think the comments made here will be taken well by Lucky and ensure cautious and proper use of admin powers. 
support,Supprot I thought he was an adm already giving light to another: WTH? He isn't one already?! 
support,Definitely. I was extremely impressed with Lucky's behavior with SuperDude115. Lucky is an indispensable editor and will make a fine administrator. I trust that he will follow deletion policy to the letter when actually speedily deleting pages. 
support,Rock Solid Lucky has spent a lot of time on the Wikipedia far more than I and though he has had some previous rejected nominations for Administrator status I still stand by my previous assertion: Lucky has on balance the best interests of Wikipedia at heart. I must say that I am pleased to (in my lurkdom) see the development of a more restrained and civil temperment in moments of stress and potential or real misunderstandings in communication with others here on the Wiki. I also am impressed in how he has handled the SuperDude115 situation. That takes real understanding and concern for others here. Going the Extra Mile. On that case alone I believe he deserves support here. It is time! Yes. . . Lucky your nom here got me out of lurkdom status. . . if only for today. 
support,Should have been readmined earlier. 
support,I thought he was one?! I also trust his judgement. 
support,With over 13000 edits he's dedicated enough and I believe will make a fine admin. 
support,an excellent editor and a good man for the job. 
support,Good editor and I think that he'll make a good admin he's diligent committed to Wikipedia and has become much more thoughtful concerning adminrelated tasks. 
support,Responsible and all 'round nice guy. Anyone who knows what a W116 is can't be a bad chap. 
support,Wikipedia needs more janitors. As for the "triggerhappy" accusations he can't be called "triggerhappy" since he doesn't have a gun. 
support,OHMYGOD I almost missed your nomination! I supported the last 3 times and same goes here. 
support,&larr;
support,I knew he wasn't already but it's really really time he was! 
support,but only on the condition that he upgrades to Lucky 7.0. [[User Talk:Texture|&#964;]]
support,one of our best users. 
oppose,I have removed three speedy tags Lucky made in the last ten minutes. One on a recently uploaded image that was neither corrupted nor redundant as far as I could see and no reason was given <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Kingjameson.jpg&diff=prev&oldid=20168262> another that Lucky said was "substandard" but cited no actual criteria <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Oropouche_virus&diff=prev&oldid=20168540> another for vanity when the article clearly made an assertion of notability as a published author national speaker and newspaper writer <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kimberly_West&diff=prev&oldid=20168658>. I am seriously not comfortable with seeing speedy abilities in Lucky's hands. 
oppose,Weak oppose I also noticed he's a bit too eager to speedy stubs. 
oppose,Weak oppose per Stewart Adcock and Dmcdevit 
oppose,Strong oppose. Despite all useful contributions he just doesn't learn what innumerable people have told him for over a year including but not only in his three failed nominations; he just continues speedytagging perfectly valid stubs (<http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Weinheim&diff=18024679&oldid=18023882 like this>). He previously pledged to stop that but didn't so no matter what he promises with adminship he will not only continue that but he will directly delete such stubs. 
oppose,Trigger happy. Several times in just the last week I've thought "who'd have put a speedy tag on that? Oh its...". Having previously said he'd stop and not having done so rather leaves me wondering. And the example cited by is a case in point: if that went to VfD it's be unanimously kept as a real place and there is just absolutely no way that can be speedied. 
oppose,See commments. 
oppose,Too quick to delete and creates work for others mopping up. If he can keep his promise for a year reconsider then. 
oppose,No reason to give adminship to someone who has shown they would delete things that aren't CSDs. Seems to not use edit summaries much but even then I could find 2 or 3 instances of bad tags in the last few weeks not to mention the ones pointed out by others. The comments (as pointed out below) are also way too harsh. 
oppose,Regretfully . I hope you know I respect your editing skills and effort for the project but no one needs to be an admin to contribute. I've seen just too much evidence of speedy tagging legitimate subjects. A German town? What would even hint that that would be speediable? If you don't know what something is just clean it up and let someone else decide. Also the remarks pointed out by are unacceptable no matter who they are to. Even vandals can be treated with civility. That calms the situation down instead of escalating it. 
oppose,What Taxman said. I agree that things have improved and I'm glad Lucky is a diligent and valuable contributor but I think admins encounter enough hostility as it is and it would be better not to fan the flames. Sorry. 
oppose,agree with . 
oppose,I agree that Lucky has matured/improved a bit but I've still seen him be a bit too harsh with other users and quick to call others vandals <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Maoririder&diff=prev&oldid=19735578>. He is still quick to tag articles for speedy. Also it seems that he feels that some comments left on his talk page constitute an "invasion of privacy" and that users should resort to contact by email instead <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Mirror_Vax&oldid=19624256>. He has however contributed a great deal to wikipedia with the 6 featured articles and more than 12k edits I just do not feel adminship is appropriate/necessary at this time. [[User_talk:bmicomp|(talk]] 
oppose,I've waited a while to think things through but really just too triggerhappy. I do not trust him with the delete button. 
oppose,As an editor who consistently creates stubs and marks short articles as stubs I'm a bit disappointed that such an experienced user persists in pushing for their deletion. You don't seem to think before you act which will be catastrophic when you can actually delete articles instead of just targeting them for deletion. 
oppose,Not so much as an edit summary on articles marked as speedy and many questionable applications of the speedy criteria. 
oppose,not comfortable for the above reasons. 
oppose,[[Talk:Childlove movement/Deletion debate archive|Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Childlove movement]]: kneejerk reactions should be avoided. 
oppose,Continues to slap articles with creative deletion reasons that don't appear in [[WP:CSD]] such as today's <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Pictures_of_famous_men_with_facial_hair&diff=20509722&oldid=20509462 "Photo gallery without text possibly by User:MascotGuy">. 
support,as nominator if he accepts that is. 
support,Suhport 
support,Mild responces were a bit short but a good user third time the charm 
support,voting thing is fandangled needs to be fixed since its just a redirect. But whatever good user so I support. 
support,been here long enough and done enough to know how to use admin tools. 
support,mop will be in good hands I think. [[Image:Flag_of_Europe_and_Austria.svg|20px]] 
support,*Blink* *Blink* you mean he's not already an admin?!?!?!?! of course 
support,Sure! 
support,Absolutely. 
support,seems good to me. 
support,unlikely to abuse administrator tools. 
support,Need more admins. 
support,and damn the editcountitis. 
support,A good editor a reasonable fellow an asset to Wikipedia a deserving mopwielder. Also editcountitis is evil. 
support,Satisfied with the answer to my question. He's been around for a long time he's got a LAW for goodness' sake. 
support,Yes please low activity level or not good longterm editors shouldn't be shackled if they want to do sysoppy things. 
support,Users should not be shackled to their edit count nor to their activity level he'd use the admin powers well. 
support,as per all of the foregoing. → 
support,He will be a good admin 
support,no reason not to. 
support,Being relatively inactive is not a good reason against adminship. We most definitely do not demand that our admins put their lives on hold for Wikipedia; likewise there is no required quota for admin actions: any help is a good help. We should look to the quality of the user and whether adminship can help them help Wikipedia in what they do manage to do on Wikipedia. 
support,I like his edits.
support,That's hot. 
support,<nowiki>". $user is not already an admin?!"</nowiki> 
support,on the basis of some of the oppose votes being among the most stupid yet seen. 
support,I quote alot lately. Luigi's a guy worth trusting with the mop IMO. 
support,It's no big deal right? Plus the Everyking situation below seems silly. We need admins. 
support,it's time he finally became an admin. 
support,regrdless of 's point below. Sorry not everyone is as wikipediholic as some of us. Please no more editcountitism. Even the creator of the tool finds it somewhat wrong as she was also denied adminship on the basis of not enough edits (correct me if I am wrong). Enough of the RfA cult. 
support,to counteract remarkably stupid oppose votes noted below. There is no requirement that an admin candidate spend any particular amount of time editing and rate of edits is certainly not a valid metric of appropriateness for an admin candidate. 
support,Extreme heterosexual man support 
support,Infrequent editors can be admins too. 
support,The important thing is that he will use his power well not often.
support,block some vandals for me. 
support,I'll support. 
support,a trustworthy user. Hoping especially to counteract Everyking's blackmail attempt below. Offering to withdraw his Oppose vote for the price of an apology when the percentages are tight is ... <sorting through vocabulary ... no ... no ... not that word this is not an RFC on Everyking ... no ... good heavens not that one ... no ... no ... no... ... is wrong IMO. 
support,So what if he didnt have many edits in the past month. 
support,of course 
support,Will not abuse the tools; nay will make Wikipedia better. 
support,thoughtful and conscientious in my experience. 
support,Edit count not indicative of abilities to be an admin. He seems to know what he is doing
support,Would make a good admin [[IMHO]] </big> ([[User_Talk:Vilerage|Reply]]|[[Special:Emailuser/Vilerage|Spam Me!]]
oppose,Activity level is for me just too low. 21 edits in the last 30 days and overall less than 2 edits per day average since your last RfA where there were a number of people concerned about participation level. Kate's tool is down right now so I can't see if there's a bunch of deleted edits to your credit. Your use of edit summaries has improved since your last RfA (66% since last RfA) but it's lower than I like to see. 
oppose,I agree with Durin the activity level is way too low. Going back 100 edits takes us to 26 September 2005. Going back 500 edits takes us to 9 May 2005. This isn't about his total edit count (not even sure what it is) this is about his level of participation. 
oppose,Not even 150 edits since his last nomination. 
oppose,as above 
oppose,Low activity level 
oppose,Absolutely not. Made a false accusation against me and tried to get me sanctioned for it. 
oppose,as per Durin's point. 
oppose,per Cryptic and short answers to the questions below. 
oppose,per Durin 
oppose,as per Carbonite and Durin. 
oppose,has just nominated four school stubs for deletion with the only deletion rationale given being "Not Notable". It is hard to think why he should have done this unless he is either lazy inexperienced or given to acting in bad faith. Whatever the reason and there may well be one though I can't imagine what I really don't think he's ready for adminship. (See [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Lux Middle School]] [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Mickle Middle School]] [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Lefler Middle School]] and [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Irving Middle School]].) 
oppose,opppose because of what haeleth says 
oppose,user has been mildly disruptive as of late.
oppose,Committment is not a just a word. Show me you are serious by participating actively. Then I will support. 
oppose,Short answers coupled with less edit activity do not give me confidence; bettersafethansorry vote. 
oppose,I'm not comfortable with the AFD work a couple nominations that could have been avoided with a quick Google search [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Hoss (album)]] [[Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Stavros_Niarchos_III]]. He just doesn't seem to have put much effort into them. Other nominations have very little in the way of reasoning/rational. The comment "Because it's faster to make quick comments on IRC than it is to edit" above makes me wonder where his focus is. IRC isn't Wiki but we are a encyclopedia first and a community second spending most of his time on IRC rather than working on Wikipedia makes me concerned about priorities. 
support,has done a lot of extensive work and has proved to be a good dilligent editor. How convincing do you want a reply to "please indicate acceptance of the nomination" to be??? He's answered everything accurately and succinctly. That's an admirable skill. 
support,Metts . Plus I always support werewolves. 
support,Good contributor will use the mop well. 
support,great answers to the "candidate questions" especially. 
support,. Please commit to use edit summaries in all nonminor edits! 
support,The pop up navigation tool is incredibly useful. Shows real commitment. 
support,knows stuff well. 
support,Neutral sorry but I don't much like the answers to the Questions for the candidate. I would prefer if a little more thought was put into them. 00:52 18 August 2005 (UTC) . 
support,A valuable contributor with Wikipedia's best interests in mind. 
support,I expect this user to apply admin tools well. 
support,good edit count. 
support,oppose silly and meaningless criteria. 
support,Many good contributions. I'm confident that Lupin will use the tools well. But please do use edit summaries (you may put a bit in your JavaScript to remind you if you forget as I did). 
support,will make a great admin. 
support,I think Lupin will use the tools wisely. 
support,support as Lupin has expanded his answers below. 
support,No point in me beating a dead horse now. Your willingness to change is commendable. I do hope you were being honest when you said you'd start using edit summaries. 
oppose,didn't sound very convinving in his response to nomination. 
oppose,<del> My voting standards come down to three things: edit quality edit quantity and answers to the admin questions. You have the quantity down but not the quality as you forget to use summaries. You didn't put any thought into answering the questions. I'm sorry. 
oppose,for now but I might be willing to change my vote to support if Lupin (1) answered the questions in more detail (especially if he mentions the unauthorized bot he ran a few months ago in the conflict section) and (2) showed consistent use of edit summaries over the next few days and resolved to continue using them consistently in the future (the last part of which he's almost done). 
support,as nominator. 
support,has made many many excellent edits to articles that I watch and he has always been civil in disputes. 
support,Madchester has been at Wikipedia for a good length of time has a good amount of edits and his dedication to Live 8 and "Make Poverty History" shows he is a good person.

support,Had seen him around Wikipedia before looks good.

support,A name I'm familiar with from some of the janitorial work he's done. I didn't know much about him until now but the more I look into his edits the more impressed I am. MD should make a good admin.

support,people have to start telling me whether they're admins or not because I really thought he was one.

support,per above. 
support,You have my Vote of Confidence. 
support,minutes before the final whistle. Deserves it! 
support,Lunging lastsecond support. Wait for it...TOUCHDOWN! 
support,Needless to say I support him pending his acceptance of his nomination. 
support,I encourage him to accept. He has been a consistent editor since November 16 2004 and seems to be exceedingly polite in dealing with other users. It would be useful to have an admin to help do vandalpatrol on Argentine and other South American pages. 
support,Trustworthy and hardworking the kind of editor WP needs and the kind of admin I prefer. 
support,but most edits are very minor and sometimes doesn't use edit summeries and often when the candidate does the edit summery isn't that good such as "major edits" instead of attempting to explain edits. That said would make a good admin most definately 
support,meets . Looks like he'd make a good admin. [[user:Celestianpower|Cel]]
support,We've crossed paths on several articles mostly related to [[Football (soccer)|Football]] and [[Argentina]] and I know we can count on him.

support,Why not?

support,Tony is a great editor and would probably make a great admin as well. 
support,Very busy wikipedian to say the least.
support,A very dedicated user he has created over 250 articles including writing the vast majority of a Featured Article. Adminship should be no big deal I trust him to use the special things wisely. 
support,Sure. 
support,Absolutely 
support,(See comments.) 
support,good editor mature and civil and I expect he would use admin powers wisely. 
support,Has been patient and a good contributor since his previous nominations. His disagreements date back to when he was new to Wikipedia and didn't understand how things worked. He knows how to get along now and I'm confident he can be trusted. 
support,Tony has contributed wellresearched and comprehensive articles and engages in friendly productive discussion. 
support,Agree with comments by Mindspillage (below). 
support,I voted for Marine last time and I have no reason to change my vote this time. Marine is a highquality editor whose articles on Puerto Rico are a huge asset to Wikipedia. This user's promotion is long long overdue. 
support,Quite. 
support,I have read other people's comments and I believe everyone can get better at what they do I think Tony has done a great job in wikipedia and I am sure he will do a great job as an admin.
support,but I suggest you sign posts with <nowiki></nowiki> if you're to be an admin. 
support,</big> of course. 
support,He's a great user and has contributed a lot to articles. 
support,support. this user has grown and developed into a hard working fair editor. 
support,As for temper there are many fine tempermental admins. I trust that Marine won't abuse his admin powers. 
support,Neutral. Some people I trust are voting in support and I would like to as well. However the information presented by the opponents leads me to vote neutral. 
support,Give this man a mop! 
support,Great knowledge should be a great editor. 
support,Edit summaries may be used more. 
support,I actually intended to nominate him myself by now if I hadn't fallen off a bit in my Wikipedia activity. 
support,Suppport. 
oppose,To quote myself from last October "Admin candidates need a of work to show they understand policy and the community." I see no change after I gave this advice since his participation in the Wikipedia: space is still <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&hideminor=0&namespace=4&target=Marine_6971&limit=100&offset=0 quite limited>. Show us you're going to help with the important tasks that admins are needed for. 
oppose,Unequivocally. 
oppose,Absolutely not. There's no doubt that Marine is a valuable contributor just by the sheer volume of his additions alone. However I don't think he has the temperment to be an admin here frankly. His interactions with other users leave a lot to be desired such as when he accused me of being a racist and a vandal over a minor editing dispute. <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Modesto_Cartagena&diff=4572326&oldid=4571948> <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Gamaliel/Archive_1#Modesto_Cartagena> I'm certainly not the only editor he's had a problem with. His many biography articles are an important edition to the encyclopedia but he's also added both parent and subcategories to every one of them leaving a cluttered mess for someone else to clean up in hundreds of articles. While I certainly don't expect every admin to be an encyclopedia of rules and policies I know I'm certainly not I do expect an admin candidate to be able to use something simple like categories properly and effectively. 
oppose,What Gamaliel said. Wellmeaning contributor but not necessarily suitable for adminship. 
support,of course! great editor and keeping cool under stress. 
support,yes of course! The perfect user: quality article content courteous and constructive community interaction. 
support,a very good user. 
support,excellent editor. 
support,of course. A great editor Wikipedia needs more like him. 
support,Excellent editor certainly worthy of the extra trust. 
support,An allround excellent Wikipedian. 
support,a fine admin candidate. 
support,Of course! Mark is one of the finest editors here! . 
support,Strongly support even if I'd never seen his work before (and I have he's a great Wikipedian) the attitude towards collaboration and encouragement he displays on this page alone speaks volumes. 
support,Give this man a mop. 
support,And a bucket. 
support,And the a key to the closet. 
support,And another vote. 
support,Everything has already been said above. Strongly support.

support,Fuddle Him. Immediately 
support,I can't believe Tony beat me to this nomination! Mark has good sense and would benefit from having admin tools; he's done good work in article space as well as helping clear up disputes. 
support,out of strong respect for nominator.
support,Very impressed with his boldness when he first came here and I'm certain he can be trusted with adminship. [[Image:Yemen flag large.png|24px]] 
support,Cuddle Fuddle. 
support,who hasn't seen him about the place? [[user:Celestianpower|Cel]][[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,I've seen him all over the place and I also trust Tony's judgement as nominator. 
support,a conscientious editor who already shadows many administrative functions. His attitudes to cracking down on image misuse and copyright is commendable. Give this man a mop! 
support,I seriously need to go through [[WP:LA]] and figure out who is an admin and who isn't because I seriously thought he was one. 
support,Need more admins. 
support,&#8766; The ruddy blighter thwapped me in IRC. n00b support &#8766; Mark seems to be a good chap with a square head on his shoulders and a strong desire to improve Wikipedia. → 
support,From what I've seen he merits it. 
support,He clearly knows the rules and will use the admin tools wisely. 
support,Evenheaded open to criticism understands well the role of an admin. 
support,per nominator and others who have yet to raise a single solitary objection.
support,Yes without a doubt![[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,Per all other folks especally the bit about the square head...we need more of that. 
support,Passed lightning adminshipexam and mindspillage showed me an example of conflict resolution here: <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Elvis_Presley&diff=prev&oldid=27845641>. 
support,per my reasoning on Ianblair's RfA. 
support,confident this user would not abuse admin tools. 
support,Astonishing: I was on IRC with him at the same time (rare for me to be there) and I never heard a peep about this. That's some good nonspamming. 
support,gladly. 
support,Good lord you're not one? 
support,Extreme support per all of the above (and the RFA cliché #1 but Ral already used that one). 
support,as per nominator.

support,Of course. 
support,obvious one. Good work good user will be good admin. 
support,Always turning up on my watchlist. Plus I like the term "fuddle me" it sounds rude :D lol. 
support,Strong should have voted a long time ago despite the immenent landslide. Wikipedia needs more fuddlemarks. 
support,It's starting to get a lil tight up here on the bandwagon. 
support,Holy mackrel anoint him now great Wikipedian great guy Fuddle will truly be an admin among admins. 
support,What more can I add? 
support,I almost didn't bother checking out the RfA for a Mark Gallagher who I had never heard of but luckily I did for Mark is fuddlemark in disguise. Whatever name he uses he is a fine Wikipedian and deserves to enter the pantheon of admins. 
support,I'm tempted to oppose simply because he told me that he wouldn't run for admin until January when I wanted to nominate him. But I won't. I'll find some other way to get even with him (evil laugh). 
support,has made valuable contributions as a user and I'm sure he will make a fine admin. 
support,He isn't an admin? Well I'll be fuddled! I'll add my support despite him being an Aussie ;) for three reasons: 1) Mark's a great wikipedian; 2) he'll make a great admin; 3) Tony's refreshingly honest nomination! 
support,Speedy Of course Outstanding User 
support,this is going to pass I'm just doing it for more edits....Mwahahahahahahaha!!!!! Okay maybe I just want to support or do I? 
support,A solid nonfool; well deserved. 
support,Strong This fine Australian editor has done wonders for this project and I'm extremely happy to support his nomination. Cheers 
support,Hah he said Crickey whoops! Should that have been bolded? Anyways good user and total support.

support,Speedy support That's right just close this now and promote him. 
support,Excellent contributer. Would have voted sooner but I decided not to vote during my own RFA. 
support,of course. 
support,Strewth I know some say that he doesn't know Christmas from Bourke Street but I reckon and he's cunning as a dunny rat and he'll be flat out like a lizard drinking clearing out admin backlogs plus has Buckley's chance of abusing his powers.

support,would make great admin. | [[User talk:Flcelloguy|A note? ]]</font color>| 
support,He's a productive guy. 
support,He added a nice bit of badlyneeded sanity to the whole Sollog mess and does good work both editing and resolving problems. 
support,a truly excellent candidate. Contribs and talk pages all show what I like to see. 
support,MarkSweep should have a broom. 
support,Cool. 
support,Excellent editor will certainly be an excellent administrator. 
support,There may be disagreements over content issues but anyone can see when someone is using his head and not his heart when attemting to find a solution out of sticky issues. Marksweep is clearly one of them. ;)
support,Has demonstrated ability to remain cool under pressure. 
support,I agree with Hoary 
support,Anyone who frustrates a vandal that much deserves to be an admin. 
support,Ditto.....
support,excellent line of thought and a fair contributor to the community. 
support,clearly qualified and would be a valued admin. 
support,this user meets my criterion of not being a vandal. 
support,wellqualified. Glad to know he isn't a vandal too. ;) 
support,Solid user. I don't know if you were aware of this or not but this nomination was vandalized the other day. A sockpuppet added around 13 fake votes in opposition. I reverted them and posted the sockpuppet on [[WP:VIP]]. He was banned the following day. He (or she I don't know for sure) demonstrated great hatred towards both you and your nominator . 
support,previous comments covered it. [[Special:Contributions/Who|&infin;]]
support,Appears to have the qualities necessary to make a good administrator. 
support,MarkSweep is an accomplished diplomat when other editors let the tension get to them. 
support,Very active in reverting vandalism and would benefit with the admin rollback tool. 
support,with two thumbs up. 
support,Baaa... 
support,I support even though he has goons that wrote on my talk page. 
support,we haven't met so this may be a sheep vote. 
support,Sopport. I've been running into him on the mathematical articles and I saw that he was very helpful so I'm confident he will be a good admin. 
support,I've been favorably impressed by his handling of some intransigent editors. 
support,Although I resent his fraudulent use of my name because he's a fine Wikipedian. 
support,Strong Also an apology to MarkSweep for making a conclusion on a couple of outofcontext diffs 
support,Anyone who can get and to agree on anything should probably be a mediator or nominated for sainthood. ;) 
support,What nonsense. I should not have to vote for this. I'd vouch for him but I'm not sure he wouldn't actually have to vouch for me instead. Fellow [[Sollog]] editor. 
support,Sweep. 
support,I missed this vote earlier. Good editor. 
support,:O What do you mean he wasn't one already! 
support,I've seen this chap around a lot; particularly the whole [[Sollog]] thing which I was part of as well. In fact I ditto his comments about maturation etc; I started off quite combatative and mellowed myself so I feel a supernatural...connection with this man a... subperceptual cognitive harmonisation.
support,Very good and supportive editor I honestly thought he already was an admin.
support,Eeek. Almost missed this one. . 
oppose,I am fully aware I am outnumbered here however I would like to point out that MarkSweep opposed my application of removing personal attacks and did not file an RfC or anything on the matter but simply went straight for a [[Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/AI|requestion for arbitration]] "against" me where he made biased generalizations about my communication instead of taking a full look into my handling of communications by others. 
support,I trust the nominator. [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,Because of his work on [[Oh My Goddess!]] it became a [[WP:FAC]]. In order to do that you must be civil compromising and deal with many people. This user showed that his conduct is civil and he works well with others. However I do caution him that with some of the articles he edits they are under constant revert wars so he needs to be careful before he starts blocking people and locking articles like [[Bogdanov Affair]]. Nonetheless I still support.

support,enjoy adminship. 
support,the Redwolf24 adminnominating cabal. ; ) 
support,Always nice to see him on IRC too. Shall be a fine addition.
support,4600 edits is quite enough and his protectionist leanings are a plus. 
support,Seems quite capable and reasonable. Sorry wasn't logged in before.
support,certainly. This user has proven himself to be a most committed and hardworking contributor to our project and has made a wide range of contributions in many different areas. Whilst I personally disagree with this user's somewhat protectionist stance and with a few slightly questionable actions on his part I would still expect that he would exercise good judgement as an admin and often such matters are opinion based rather than any kind of factual input (Bogdanov Affair is a particular case where protection is understandable since it has turned into a mudslinging match between two POVwarring parties). I expect that Maru shall be an asset to our community as an admin. 
support,Surprised he was not an admin already.... 
support,Oh yes you know I'm down. 
oppose,Strongly oppose. Advocates permanant protection of [[Bogdanov Affair]] on WP:RFAR showing a lack of understanding of wikiculture and protection policy. 
oppose,Further interaction with this editor has left me feeling unsettled as to his abilities and motivations. I will not support. 
oppose,On the "oppose" side of neutral re: the [[Bogdanov Affair]] affair for the moment 
support,Mais bien sûr! 
support,support Looks like a solid candidate. 
support,I'll trust that Master Thief will accept (I see no record of it on his or Grutness' talk page) and I know how good he is as taking care of vandals. 
support,Absolutely. 
support,seems to be a very dedicated user and devoted to fighting vandalism. 
support,j'ai un grand crayon. and I intend to use it. Seriously with all the work that I have seen do I was under the impression that he was an admin already. Good and well thought out edits and comments. [[Special:Contributions/Who|&infin;]]

support,good candidate. I like what I see.

support,As strong as it gets. Garrett is one of the best Wikipedians I've met. 
support,I wanna be the last guy to vote ; )
oppose,Three months is not enough for me. 
oppose,Great work. Just keep it up for another few months without burning out or flipping out and I'll change my vote to support then. For now three months is insufficient. 
oppose,Opppose. 3500 edits is quite commendable but he is still a little too green. Once he is renominated I will change my vote if he keeps on the same track. 
oppose,Three months or so is far too early for a nomination. I recommend withdrawal and reconsideration in early September.

support,Wow you are not a admin Wow 
support,one of the best requests I've ever read. 
support,You seem quite ready for that mop and bucket.
support,I'm usually leery of supporting selfnominations but I know and trust Mindmatrix's judgement. So I guess I'll support this. 
support,great editor. 
support,May the Force be with you! 
support,not least as it's the first RfA which made me laugh! (Oh and he seems like a great editor too!) 
support,Heh. I remember that time i blocked this guy. I just wonder if he'll speedy delete 100 pages in 5 minutes. That'd be useful assuming "he" (or is it a bot!) can make judgement calls that fast. 
support,From my experiences he'd make a good admin. 
support,Positive interactions though he has a scary habit of occasionally taking over my watchlist with his restubbing. ;) 
support,This RfA is a [[WP:STUB|stub]]. You can help Wikipedia by <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Mindmatrix&action=edit voting on it> 
support,already working on a serious administrative nightmarish task... give em the mop already. 
support,mopworthy material I'd say hand it over. 
support,I'm fairly new and he's one of the people that I'm learning the most from. 
support,MM has done some superb writing; is community spirited technically wellversed and has a keen sense of humour (note Canadian spelling). He will do credit to the term "Admin." 
support,! Mindmatrix has been very helpfull in every aspect whenever I have the chance to work with him. He is also a very fast and assiduous worker. 
support,Great edits. Awesome sense of humor. Would be a great admin. 
oppose,Same as . Notify me too.May the Force be with you! 
support,Besides I'm partial to [[double reed]]s.

support,a superb editor with extraordinary common sense. Hard to find a better admin candidate. 
support,What they said. 
support,I have seen her work all over the place and I think she will make an excellent admin. 
support,Very much so. 
support,Her user and talk pages show us someone who communicates and works well with others. 
support,Of course. 
support,The sooner the better. 
support,certainly. 
support,seen some of her edits quality stuff! =)
support,I concur with User:Plato. 
support,Often seen her edits around and they are always wellreasoned.

support,read your user and talk page very impressed plus the comments made by the other supporters convinced me. 
support,! Already acting like an admin! Oh and one terrific trollslayer to boot. 
support,But of course. 
oppose,You have the support of the called a users a "looker" who appears to vote based on his 'like' to other users (see his vote above and comments <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Lst27&diff=4711075&oldid=4701648 here>).It is outrageous and I can`t get over it. My vote can not turn to yes under any condition I am very sad to vote no because of this third party but I am affraid that users like will be able to continue with such behavior.

support,seems like a good user who uses edit summaries most of the time and is big on vandalism fighting. Go for it!
support,Last week it seemed hard to imagine that reasons for opposition could get more utterly absurd but the hole keeps getting deeper. Hopefully Mo0 will pass despite this; he is not likely to abuse admin tools. 
support,good antivandal device works well under fire. 
support,Good vandal fighter we could do with someone to block persistant vandals. 
support,1700 edits is 400 more than I had. Vandalfighters can use a rollback button and I see nothing that would lead me to believe he would abuse admin tools. 
support,You get your talk page vandalised a lot. I think that's a good enough reason. Aside from that this is a good user. 
support,Well maybe I should opose because he likes to hurt people and his userpage is vandalised alot: but I wont. I can't see any visable signs of reasons to not support him and he seems an overall good and worthwhile member. (Rephrased due to objection/confusion) 
support,Have seen MoO around antivandalism efforts. Always stays calm. 
support,Of course! Great vandal fighting work! 
support,see no reason to oppose.
support,Per everybody else.
support,Excellent editor. Single oppose vote poorly reasoned. 
support,Gladly.

support,what a travesty that he isn't already... [[user:Celestianpower|Cel]][[WP:ESP|e]]

I think that you should need a bit more in order to be admin. Also your talk page seems to be vandalised a lot. I don't think that's a good sign.

support,again I thought he was one. [[user:Celestianpower|Cel]][[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,Absent Minded Nominator I used to feel like Lulu heck I even asked at one point what I could do to stop the POV wars me and him had. That was back when me and MONGO were newcomers. He's a right winger i'm a left winger. In the real world we might have disagreements but on Wikipedia we're all family: this project supercedes any ideology when you're on here IMO. I can only hope the rest of the world feels that way about respecting their fellow man someday and rise above their differences. 
support,MONGO is an OK bloke. 
support,good editor and will be great admin.
support,On wikibreak but spotted this. All of my experiences with Mongo have left me with a great impression. He is both dedicated to wikipedia and helpful.[[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,seems good. 
support,Cliché #1. 
support,Its about time! I was about to nominate him myself.
support,excellent vandal fighter. 
support,Good editor I have had positive experiences with him 
support,Strong Excellent user another RFA that I got beatin on to nominate 
support,[[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e</i]]>
support,won over by the strength of your answer to question #4. 
support,I did some research looked at the answers and decided that I should be acting in good faith in this matter and voting for support. Regardless of the user's past he's explained his actions to a degree that satisfies me. I am always willing to give someone a chance if they show the proper attitude and I think that MONGO shows that attitude. 
support,Extreme Cheesehead Nice user level headed (unlike me) and I honestly thought he was one. 
support,per the answer to question #4. However I must say you've got to work on your temper a little bit. As an admin you'll be on the front lines against vandalism and some vandals will go to the point of death threats to continue with their lunacy. I'm confident that you'll learn to stay cool even in those situations. 
support,but I second what Titoxd says about your temper.
support,Bygones are still bygones. 
support,Nobrainer. 
support,Republican senator voting for Justice Breyer or Democrat senator voting for Chief Justice Roberts I was going to vote neutral but I am going to assume good faith here and vote to give this user the mop. I think Mongo will watch his temper and has lightened his POV in recent months. Also support votes and/or lukewarm opposition by some wikipedians that have had issues with the user in the past help convince me to vote for a qualified if controvesial user. 
support,I was definitely put off by MONGO's attitude at (then) Wikipedians for Decency but from what I have seen he has really turned it around. I am happy to support him now. 
support,I have no reservations. 
support,agree with ArseJay :D [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,Users who go through this type of controversy are some of the best kinds they know how to deal with POV while not forgetting that POV users can add to the project. I'm convinced MONGO will do a good job. 
support,I think MONGO will be a fine admin. 
support,Have always had good interactions and I believe some claims below are being blown out of proportions. 
support,Has been extremely helpful and also courteous and I've noticed him making very numerous helpful changes to a number of articles. Perfect candidate has patience with all sorts of contributors from newcomers to angry ideologues and good judgment. Definitely support. 
support,Good candidate. 
support,Most of the diffs below look bad but they were from ages ago (one I checked was from Janunary!) I think he's grown since then. 
support,I've rarely read so thoroughly through a user contribs for an RfA as I've done with this one. Agreed most of the oppose arguments raise my eyebrows most notably those Mr Tibbs mentioned. Leftist foreigners might also have an opinion worth including. But checking through his last 1000 or so there seems to be few POV edits (seemingly none tho i havent checked them all) or potentially worse reverts. All the ugly edits seem to date from August or so. Admittedly this is strange as you would expect somebody who has been with WP since January to know better. Nonetheless he seems to have picked up on the criticism. I especially found his remarks on [[User talk:Agriculture]] on everybody just doing their best to reach NPOV very positive (hopefully he includes leftist foreigners in this show of AGF ;) ) and i find his work since then to be excellent especially in vandal reverting. 
support,After careful review of his history I am changing my vote to 
support,should be no big deal. Seems to have learned a lot since he got here. 
support,'n stuff. 
support,His positive contributions vastly outweigh the missteps of his past. 
support,Humorous and fun but need to watch out a bit with his humor. 
support,MONGO has done great work on [[George W. Bush]] and other articles. 
support,Strong and resilient in the face of vandals on Bush's page. Just keep your head in disputes and you'll be a great admin. 
support,I have been impressed by the level head he's kept on this RfA and <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMarkGallagher&diff=28568339&oldid=28566707 he has assured me> that his recent offensive edit summaries were meant jokingly. I've done the same myself (as has who I nominated not so long ago). MONGO can rest assured though that I'll be (metaphorically) defeaning him with the aid of a (metaphorical) bullhorn held (metaphorically) at close range if I imagine he doesn't show proper respect for nonAmericans in the future ... 
support,Speaking of metaphors if I'm doing the right deviation thing here might as well take it the whole the way. With great trepidation etc. 
support,Strong 
support,Looks fine to me. 
support,Strong affirmative action a good helpful user and conservative rural Americans are an exotic species among admins. 
support,I appreciate his handling of the talk page of [[George W. Bush]]; clearly one who survives in this environment will be comfortable in easier situations. 
support,Seems to have learned from past mistakes. 
oppose,My experience with MONGO was via [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Wikipedians for encyclopedic merit]] and various talk pages that spun off that where he was consistently belligerent and confrontational with multiple editors (including myself). Moreover much of his confrontation was around him pushing very POV political opinions. A look at MONGO's user talk page shows a lot of further rancor as well.(followup: MONGO's below answer shows a growth of maturity; however additional evidence located by Mr. Tibbs is troubling too. I think less than 3 months of good interaction is not quite enough; I would support the nomination in another 3 months if those see good cooperation) 
oppose,I'm afraid I must object. When the WikiProject for Encyclopedic Merit was originally founded MONGO spent a lot of time arguing (and edit warring) about which usernames were allowed on its membership roster leading eventually to the page being protected. I don't find that attitude very constructive. 
oppose,Strong oppose as per the reasons above. Mongo does not have the temperament for adminship. 
oppose,per Radiant. Too controversial for adminship at this time. 
oppose,per Radiant. 
oppose,Strong Oppose A cursory glance at this user's article edit history reveals many destructive edits. Some of them even with inflammatory statements in the Edit Summary like: "It looks like foreigners and leftists wish to control this page....good luck!" <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=George_W._Bush&diff=prev&oldid=9457366>. Some other edits following this pattern: <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=George_W._Bush&diff=prev&oldid=9456163> <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=George_W._Bush&diff=prev&oldid=13857417> <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=George_W._Bush&diff=prev&oldid=13865785>. And it's not just the Bush article either here are some more recent ones: <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2003_Invasion_of_Iraq&diff=prev&oldid=21491567> <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2003_Invasion_of_Iraq&diff=prev&oldid=21513758> 
oppose,Object. Disruptive actions in August are far too recent for me to support now. 
oppose,I'm troubled by the concerns brought up by multiple users. 
oppose,offensive username. 
oppose,Enough volume of troubling concerns raised that makes me not comfortable with MONGO's promotion at this time. A few more months of trouble free editing and I'm sure you'll be a shoe in. 
oppose,The whole Wikipedians for encyclopedic merit thing just scares me I'm having trouble seeing past what appear to be bad faith edits and opinions that relate to this project and spill over into the 'pedia proper. Sorry. ➨ [[User_talk:Redvers|❝]]
oppose,It seems that for the most part when MONGO comes to my attention it's been for the wrong reasons. That could be that he edits under my radar much of the time but the other oppose votes above suggest this is not the case. The edit summaries from August cast a long dark shadow over the time since then and I'm not yet certain that enough water has passed under enough bridges to lend my support at present: any editor with that in their past and the misbehviour on the project does imo need to pass a noticeably higher bar before my fears are satisfactorily laid to rest. One point in particular: do not get involved in situations unless you are prepared to do all the necessary legwork it looks bad feels bad and as turned out here doesn't usually work. Still I'm sure there's plenty to learn from in this RfA so a few more months solid sound editing and goodthingsontheradar should be in the offing. 
oppose,Managing to be civil and measured for one week during the RfA doesn't excuse previous actions. 
oppose,per Redvers and Radiant and I generally agree with Carbonite's past reason for opposing. One week of good behavior is rather easy to do but I'd like to see MONGO in the trenches for a few more months before supporting particularly in light of his involvement with [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Wikipedians for encyclopedic merit]] (the AfD for that brought a lot of concerns over censorship and [[WP:NOT]] censored. I was among the editors that said that the existence of that WikiProject went against our policies.). Also removing established editors from a WikiProject if they have listed themselves there is wrong and borders on vandalism. 
support,I've seen Moriori's edits here ever since I got involved and they've always been good.
support,Seems to be a good editor and I trust the judgement of the nominator. 
support,A definite support for this candidate. He has been here for over one and a half years which is more than plenty of time for me to consider this contributor "mature." 
support,2500 edits over ~18 months seems slightly slim to me but the quality of those edits more than makes up for any such concerns IMO. 
support,A good well rounded editor.(Donovan|[[w:en:User:Geocachernemesis|Geocachernemesis]]|

support,a very fine candidate indeed. 
support,(slaps head) I nominated him then forgot to vote! ! 
support,from an editor across "[[Tasman Sea|The Ditch]]" 
support,although why a user has made so few "nicely balanced" edits makes him a good candidate is beyond me. I think mine are "nicely balanced" as well and nobody's bothered to use it as a rationale to nominate me for adminship. My support vote is based entirely upon quality of edits and the fact that this user has not become belligerantly entangled in disputes. (Note: I'm currently entangled in a rather massive dispute although I hope it's not as a belligerant...) 
support,Cool. 
support,No evidence that this user would go on a vandalism or image deletion spree.

support,Sound judgment excellent contributor. 
support,Strong I don't believe that I've ever made an easier decision.
support,She's knowledgeable. 
support,I only read the first 30 "supports" (in addition to the "nomination" and "opposes") but I have to say that I agree with all of the comments in those "supports" and in the "nomination." When I became an editor and had questions she was the single most helpful person on Wikipedia to me. [[Special:Contributions/DoctorW|c]][[User_talk:DoctorW|t]]
support,nothing but positives vibes here...well 90+% so PILE ON :>
support,already an admin why are we going through this charade of an Rf... no that's not that funny. Oh well too late now. of course! 
support,Ann has demonstrated her unfailing commitment to the idea that consensus and NPOV will ultimately result in a highquality unbiased encyclopedia. I've also seen her on many occasions working to soothe conflicts and informally mediate disputes. She knows how to handle herself in a conflict (she rarely if ever gives anyone genuine reason to have a conflict with her) and knows how to advise others when they are in such a situation. She also knows how to respect consensus even when it goes against her as well as how to compromise in order to achieve it. I've been considering nominating her for some time now actually though I had planned to wait until next year (and see if it happened in some other way). Ann has been building experience of late doing the admin "mopping up" jobs that naturally lead to adminship. 
support,Certainly. 
support,truly the best choice of the pool of nonadmins. [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,Strong While excessive online time expenditures are bad and may prove harmful to Ann (I for example have retired for now) I support her candidacy (and hope she doesn't burnout by spending too much time online). She is honest but polite and considerate and knowledgeable on all things Wikipedia by experience firsthand. Also I can say that I personally have known her for a long time and do not need to rely on a glimpse of one or two isolated edits in the same way that some people vote on candidates whom they don't know based merely on superficial information. Ann is human but she does well anyhow. I support her nomination.
support,I was starting to wonder when she was going to be nominated. 
support,definitely would have nominated earlier. Absolutely no problem supporting now. 
support,excellent editor calm and thoughtful and I've been noticing her work for a while. 
support,I have read the whole page and some of her articles and she seems quite capable.
support,! I have gotten a very positive impression of her and looking at her contributions this impression is more than confirmed 
support,This one is a duh. 
support,conscientious and responsible editor dives into the pool of conflict and emerges dry. 
support,per Free the WP! Winnow the arbitrators ! Just kidding. WTF? 
support,figured she already was an admin. 
support,as above. I figured she was an admin too. I'm pretty new here but everything I've seen from her is indicative of a prime candidate for adminship. 
support,a pleasant and polite user very knowlegable and despite her strong views on religion is able to 'seperate church and state' as it were. 
support,sUPPORT aRRGGH STUPID CAPS LOCK 
support,Utmost support. I would struggle to think of a more suited user on Wikipedia. I've never seen her be anything but courteous and she edits in areas that can sometimes be heated. 
support,Never thought I'd say this but I actually did think she was an admin. 
support,Of course. 
support,as very well outlined above. 
support,a courteous helpful mediating editor; a real asset. 
support,Nothing more to say at this point. Good luck Ann. 
support,Yeah.

support,As a nominator I of course fully support Michael.
support,From what I have seen this user is polite thinks clearly and overall seems trustworthy. I have seen nothing to suggest that he would be anything other than an excellent admin. 
support,I'd question his abidance to the NPOV principles on some topics but I've seen nothing to suggest that he shouldn't be an admin. I agree with the statement cosigned by Ëzhiki and Irpen. 
support,As a conominator I of course fully support Michael.
support,a wellrounded editor. Seems to know when to let go and when to actually take a stand which in my opionion is one of the best qualities a candidate for adminship can have.

This user has shown good civility on talk pages and a definite desire to collaborate within the community. (Also having a native Portuguese speaker around is always useful!) I am certain this user will make an excellent admin.

support,After having made a study of Nandesuka's contributions I realize that he is an excellent contributor to the encyclopedia who would make good use of administraor tools. 
support,The best answer to question 3 all month. 
support,Whenever I've come across Nandesuka (a thing that seems to happen frequently) he's being levelheaded and thorough. 
support,great editor with lots of contributions in the Main WP and WPTalk spaces. What I've noticed suggests a responsible individual who is able to substantiate his views reasonably and knowledgeably and who has that grasp of WP policies required of admins.
support,no reason to believe he would abuse admin powers. 
support,After looking through Nandesuka's edit history over the last day I have found nothing but reasons to support this user's candidacy. Nandesuka has made excellent edits since his arrival here in March making use of enviably good edit summaries. He has edits spread out through many namespaces and a good number of user talk page edits. It seems to me from a review of contribs and from personal experience that Nandesuka is quite levelheaded at VfD/AfD. No reservations. 
support,to counteract some opposition for the wrong reason (If soemone has voted deleted in an AfD discussion they can't close the vote anyway). 
support,A user who understands and supports the existing policies and he has been level headed and kept his cool. 
support,thoughtful intelligent patient and altogether a suitable admin. 
support,Sapōto desu. 
support,Nandesuka has impressed me with his/her ability to cut to the point of heated discussions of [[WP:TOBY]] & [[WP:ZAP]]. S/he is direct calm and civil: all good things. 
support,But please tell me your sex so I can refer to you as him or her rather than they? [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,Excellent edits good common sense. I'm having a [[Masako Natsume|Tripitaka]] moment. 
support,Has a recent update of the common sense plugin and appears to be getting better at handling wikiconflict. 
support,What can I say? I was <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AHermione1980&diff=23129829&oldid=23126160 coerced> into it!!11!!1 Seriously Nandesuka seems like a good contributor and I'm happy to support him. 
support,Excellent candidate right amount of experience. Nandesuka and I have some very serious points of disagreement but I have always found his manner agreeable. He has not displayed serious antagonism and I think that's impressive. I value that skill and think he'd be an asset to Wikipedia as a sysop. I think some of the opposition may be ideologicalwell I encountered some of that when I was up for sysop (can you say "autofellatio" children?) Such ephemeral issues pass and what matters is how the candidate handles situations. Give him the mop and bucket. 
support,I am voting largely to counterbalance the weirdly large number of oppose votes that don't really cite actionable criticisms. I see no valid reasons to oppose this user. 
support,Having looked through Nandesuka's contributions in the wikipedia and assorted talk namespaces I've noticed many statements from Nandesuka that are the statements I'd have made in that situation. As such I feel able to trust him as a sysop. 
support,Extreme lesbian support! 
support,Sounds good to me. 
support,After looking through Nandesuka's contributions and talk page I believe he would make a good administrator. 
support,What Andre said. 
support,Very Good in VFDs will make a good administrator 
support,An editor's value to wikipedia should not be measured in edit counts. Much more levelheaded at dealing with conflicts than I am. Go go go! 
support,The more sarcasm the better as far as I'm concerned. 
support,After looking through his recent edits can't see anything bad. And some of the later Oppose votes convinced me. 
support,Based on looking through the user contributions and interaction on the (highly stressinducing) [[Wikipedia talk:Toby]] discussion I believe Nandesuka presents proper rational comments and motivations. 
support,Good contributor seems to understand policy well no reason to think he will abuse amin powers. 
support,Obviously a good editor. I don't think there is any reasons that he shouldn't be an admin. 
support,Absolutely Great editor easy to work with does a lot of good work all mentioned above. [[Special:Contributions/Who|&infin;]]
support,This looks like a close one; a good editor reasonable I just don't find the opposition compelling. 
support,Seems up to the job. 
oppose,disagree with Zoe that this is a good candidate. 
oppose,Weak oppose agree with Silensor. 
oppose,user is far too enthusiastic to delete and overtly confrontational during the normal course of discussion on VfD. 
oppose,Moving to oppose now. I'm not satisfied with the answer I got below (in "comment" section) and he doesn't really seem to fully understand the Wikipedia idea of consensus. You said that you only called them votes because of the old VFD name (which still isn't good) but you recently <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion/Log/2005_September_5&diff=prev&oldid=22654949 "voted" in CFD> warned someone about having a "vote" count twice <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tinsley79&diff=prev&oldid=22673087>. Also your "welcome to Wikipedia" remark [[Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Punggol_Bus_Interchange|here]] to definitely was not "within reason" but extremely condescending as well as <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Tinsley79&diff=prev&oldid=22673087 here> where you call a nomination "a joke" (when it was certainly in good faith with a plausible basis). I'd like to see some improvement and more participation in the Wikipedia namespace outside of deletion debates and I'll support in a couple of months. 
oppose,Quite apart from the sarcastic comments Nandesuka hasn't been here quite long enough or made enough contributions to article space for me. 
oppose,User has no featured articles that I am aware of too low of an edit count not enough effort on editing/creating side of wikipedia. 
oppose,He is very very rude and condessending. He always votes to delete and makes funn of others all the time.
oppose,Disclosure: This user and I are currently in the middle of a petty dispute. My opinion is that he fails to undertand the nature of civilized discourse plenty of civility or at least welldisguised hostility (which may very well be the definition of civility) but little grasp of rationality. He should be a mediator not a trustee of factual truth. 
oppose,Too keen to delete. 
oppose,No way.

support,a very civil bright helpful editor. 
support,I almost got a shock reading Boston's comments below but I am more shocked knowing I have been talking to a she than a he all along. (giving a guage of my true level of "shock"? :D) Anyhow she has been one of the most active not only in content addition but also in talkpages getting involved in disputes and basically still managing to come out of them with a good reputation (in particular the recent clashes in opinion over [[Nguyen Tuong Van]]). Certainly not an easy feat over a very touchy topic for various cultures.
support,although I'm far from being communist despite what one particular editor might think. 
support,[[Wikipedia:Esperanza|ε]]
support,I worked with this user briefly on how to draw the Signapore flag since she is from there. She was pretty helpful with her suggestions and I was glad she gave me the OK on the drawing. I believe she will make a good admin dispite what occured below. 
support,In addition to Freakofnurture's comments; one does not need to agree with someone's political ideas in order to think that he/she will make a great admin. 
support,Will make a great admin. 
support,Seems like a great candidate to me. Keep up the good work. 
support,support; a) don't want the wrong lizard; b) admin shouldn't be too big a deal and she seems to be a good contributor c) looking back into history of talks she seems to communicate well with other users and has done for a long time. 
support,Appears to have the personality needed to handle Admin tasks well. 
support,We both like Marx but with me it's [[Groucho Marx|Groucho]] 
support,excellent vandal fighter and NPOV editor just what we need in an admin. Of course a great content contributor too. 
support,Good contributor and janitor. 
support,I have to oppose for now. support I too got into a heated discussion with Natalina on the [[Talk:Photosynthesis#splitting_water|photosynthesis page]]. She agressively reverted my edits despite disccusion on the talk page where I was trying to point out the scientific errors she was making in her edits. She finally accused me of making personal attacks because I refused to agree with her interpretation. It took A LOT of discussion to persuade her that her edits were factual errors. I find it worrying that an editor can be so strong willed when they are editing material for which they do not have a strong grasp. I suggest that rather than digging in and fighting she should review her position if challeneged with reasonable rebuttals. If this had been a one off incident it would not be a problem but her strong personality is coming out on this page too. The many 3RR offenses are unacceptable. On the positive side when she is making edits that agree with consensus she does a good job. She also makes valuable contributions on the [[Wikipedia:Reference_desk/Science]]. I doubt my oppose vote will stop her becoming an admin but i am still going to vote this way since I hope Natalina will look at her previous actions and learn to be less of a bull in a china shop when other editors disagree with her. Please take this as constructive criticism. 
support,Even though this vote seems a forgone conclusion just wanted to still express my support.
support,commie [[User talk:Wikiacc|«]] 
support,The "can't support communists" oppose vote was funny. 
support,Bandwagon. 
support,My feeling is that this editor is earnest and observant. 
oppose,I have misgivings about giving admin to this user. The user engages in revert wars and has been warned continued his/her revert wars and was suspended. The user has been asked to agree to cease this behavior but has not agreed. The user has repeatedly failed to give newcomers the assumption of good faith but has treated them as vandals. The user does not practice the guidelines of conflict avoidance / conflict resolution. I think the user could benefit from a thorough review of the Wikipedia guidelines and I would appreciate from him/her a statement that he/she will abide by such. Only after a period of demonstrating adherence to the guidelines over a period of time would I consider supporting the user's admin candidacy. 
oppose,Sorry but I can't support communists... 
oppose,. Very good user but a little aggressive at times in discussions so just keep cool when acting as an admin. 
oppose,as per . Candidate's behavior in editing disputes including one currently involving me is inconsistent with admin responsibilities. 
support,of course if only because the nominator spoke so eloquently. ;) 
support,because work is over for the day. 
support,fine and helpful gentleman I am happy to support. (Please set your email though; I agree that is important.) 
support,Total and complete loser I'd never support this person this user needs atleast 100000 edits to get my vote! Oh....I mean 
support,agree about email. 
support,We need a few first class hard core editors with admin rights. His "Unadulterated rubbish" in nominating [[Chepstow School]] for deletion a few days ago also caught my eye and made me laughthe article was indeed complete bilge at the time of nomination. Articulate intelligent. Give him the mop. 
support,Very nice. Would make a good admin.
support,Although I'm not personally familiar with this editor a quick look through some diffs in his edit history show quite a capable editor and his answers to the questions are more than adequate. 
support,An obvious candidate for admin. Great editor. 
support,Another good candidate. 
support,Suppoer. 
support,good editor 
support,yep 
support,Don't really know this user but a good search of this editors articles shows that he makes edits that are conductive to Wikipedia.

support,Just get these edit summaries going officer. 
support,Gladly. 
support,Definitely admin material. 
support,another fine candidate. 
support,Looks like a good contributor no reason to think Admin tools will be abused. 
support,Some reason all the articles i edit i always see his name and the changes and he does a good job and i think he is very dedicated he even offered me advice about Military uniform. 
support,Dedication to detail and NPOV and his good edits lead me to say he deserves Adminship. 
support,Ngb has been here since November 2003 though he has only accumulated a total edit count of 1300. He seems to do quite a good job on cricketrelated articles and has done some wikifying and a little bit of vandalism reverts. There has been participation in VfD and CfD and he does seem to have basic knowledge on adminrelated things. He's not "very" experienced but at least I think he is suitable for adminship. 
support,deals with vandals participates on VfD talk with others writes edit summaries. While the edit count isn't astronomical Ngb looks knowledgeable of Wikipedia and helps in specific area. I think [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Biekko]] could be seen as precedent for such situations. 
support,Good record experienced enough.~ 
support,done a lot of work for cricket 
support,a very worthy candidate 
support,This is long overdue. 
support,Following his answer to my query in the comments section below I vote support. 
support,Weak Seems to be a great editor but number of edits worries me a bit. 
support,As far as I am concerned this one is scampering away towards the boundary at deep extra cover with no fielder in sight. 
support,Oh yeah. Absolutely support this guy. He's been here over two years and he ought to know the wikiropes. 
support,Probably less active then the average admin but not inactive enough for disqualification. Good work on VFD and cricketrelated articles.

support,A trustworthy and dedicated editor. I hope you make it to [[Australia]] one day too!
support,This editor has won my respect through his exemplary thoughtful and diplomatic approach to a vfd I initiated against a project to which he was deeply dedicated (see [[Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Nottinghamshire v Yorkshire 26 June 2005]] for details). 
support,I know him from [[WP:Cricket]]

support,Enthusiastic support! 
support,I doubt he will accept but I would like to be on the record as supporting anyhow. 
support,It should also be noted that he's a contributing member of [[Wikipedia:WikiProject_Spoken_Wikipedia|WikiProject Spoken Wikipedia]] which gives few edits to show for very tedious work. 
support,Nicholas Turnbull has all the qualities needed to be a team player. He's more concerned with the editing and with the quality of his edits than arguing over what he edits/how he edits etc. Off his own back he revived the continuingtobeasuccess Mediation Cabal managed to avoid burning out on the AI arbcom case and the XAL situation with the Bogdanoff Affair. Nicholas contributes tirelessly and unceasingly to the good of the project as a whole; keeping an eye on the minutae without losing sight of the bigger picture. I can't really do much more to convince the skeptics of his worthiness and as I know he doesn't view adminship as a big deal I know he isn't going to want me to say any more. 
support,I'm a bit iffy what with suffering a minor case of editcountitis (don't worry my edit count's about the same as Nick's) but I think in cases of extreme awesomitude we can thrust forth the mop and bucket a little early. Nicholas has made uniformly good contributions is levelheaded and frankly sums up "extreme awesomitude" quite well. It's a rare contributor who gets sysopped with so few edits but nobody said Nicholas was a dime a dozen ... 
support,enthusiastically. Any user who feels compelled to help WP by establishing ways of communication and mediation will always have me by his/her side. 
support,I tried to do this before but Nicholas wouldn't let me. Oh well here we go now. 
support,[[WP:ESP|e]]
support,overdue. 
support,[[Image:Symbol support vote.svg|15px]] Extreme Phroziac support! (
support,My concern is that Nicholas will burn out on the project and/or lose interest quickly but to tell the truth I don't think that's a reason to be neutral or heaven forbid oppose. Nicholas has been keen to learn the policies to work toward mediation when he finds conflict and to improve the project. I see no negatives at all and he keeps his cool and when he gets frustrated (and we all do) doesn't lash out. An excellent candidate and a good egg. 
support,I first met Nichols on the #wikipedia IRC channel where he is a channel op. He has an amazingly calm online presence and a superb ability to build consensus. Slow and steady wins the race so I think he'd make a great admin and possibly a mediator as well. He's also man enough NOT to quit the project if his first nomination fails. FWIW he's the one who convinced me to start listening to UninvitedCompany and to chill out more and respect consensus. We need more newcomers who can 'tame' us oldtimers. 
support,I forgot to vote! meh let me state he's a great guy always nice and nno good reason to oppose. [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,I've already trusted Nicholas with a lot more than just adminship so I can't in good conscience oppose here now can I? 
support,[[Wikipedia:Editcountitis|Remember that editcountitis can be fatal]]. 
support,methinks he should also join the wikicricket cabal. 
support,Say no to editcountitis. 
support,<del>TINIRCC</del> 
support,very committed Wikipedian who will use the tools well. 
support,he is quite reasonable and it is easy to have a discussion with him. I fully support his adminship. I hope he keeps in mind that administration is a mop rather than special authority to command others. 
support,seen around every now and then.... 
support,with my edit number 6800. And I am sure that he shall shine as an administrator. 
support,I'm glad to make my first edit to Wikipedia in several weeks this. | [[User_talk:Linuxbeak|Talk]] | 
support,This editcountitis is becoming a cancer. 
support,seems good on dispute resolution and that's a rarer skill than spellchecking. Offline editing is a good thing. 
support,good experiences with this user and I think Kim's comment about editcounting hits the nail right on the head. 
support,I don't see the edit count as a problem. 
support,Since David vouches for the quality of his edits and prospects of becoming a good admin. 
support,Strong I met Nicholas first while investigating the [[Bogdanov Affair]] and I must say I was greatly impressed with his handling of the matter. No qualms at all; in fact it's my honor. 
support,That's hot. 
support,Cool. 
support,Absofuckinglutely 
support,is there a pill you can take for editcountis? 
support,good guy. 
support,It's taken me far longer than usual because of the low edit count I felt it appropriate to investigate more of his edits than I do for candidates with a longer history. After my research I can say I'm thoroughly satisfied that Nicholas Turnbull will be a very good admin. 
support,Generally I do prefer to see 1000+ edits just to be sure the candidate knows their way around. In this case I trust the nominator and see no reaosn to penalize Nicholas for being a quick study. 
oppose,700 edits and 233 articles is simply not enough IMO. Give it some time maybe a month or two? 
oppose,Neutral. I am one of the ne'erdowells who believes that one of the requirements of adminship has to be extended participation and commitment to the project. Both to gather an understanding of the community's processes and expectations and to provide the community with a chance to get to know and understand the candidate. I have no firm threshold for edit counts and tend to adjust my opinions based on the breadth of a candidates participation the length of time with the project and the balance of substantial vs. trivial edits. However the editting record I have before me is really not what I would generally consider sufficient to meet my standards (and not helped by the fact 45% of your edits are marked as minor). The argument being made here is that this deficiency should be offset by his other activities on Wikipedia's behalf (which are of course invisible to me though I trust the descriptions offered) and because he is argued to be of an unusually good sort. I am not strongly moved by either of these arguments. To the first while I am glad that he works on IRC and email meditiation I don't really see adminship as a reward for hard work and I'm not sure these things substitute for participation in the project itself. To the second well if he is a good sort (and I have no reason to dispute that) then he would still be a good sort later on with more experience right? And it would be easier for all to see. This comment reads like an oppose and for the most part it is but I am going to stick it in neutral for now while I take some more time to consider this. 
oppose,uh it shouldn't be too hard to make another 300 or so edits... 
oppose,for now while I strongly trust David Gerard's opinion here I still think Nicholas is a tad too green for admin. Sorry Nick maybe in a month or two. 
oppose,Oppose. I had at least twice as many edits on my first RFA candidacy and I was shot down for having too few. I don't see why this should be different. 
oppose,A lost cause vote but I do think that while he seems a strong future candidate current lack of experience (and not just simple low edit count) should mean that adminship is in the future and not yet. 
support,of course. 
support,Seems like a fine candidate to me 
support,Actually thought he was an admin already. 
support,'Nother good one. 
support,Thought he was one. 
support,this maker of sensible comments—
support,though we've disagreed at times I support N unconditionally. He would be an incredible admin.

support,Has made a positive and levelheaded expression so yes. 
support,We need an infinite number of levelheaded administrators. 
support,user has many quality contributions. was planning to nominate Nlu myself.
support,excellent editor. 
support,One of the most active RC Patrollers around. 
support,RfA cliché #1. 
support,[[WP:ESP|e]]
support,! 
support,Hell Yes Good editor. 
support,Very constructive edits will make a fine admin. 
support,Ive always seen Nlu around. 
support,Admin tools will be helpful for RC patrolling. 
support,STRONG SUPPORT. A catastrophic malfunction in HTML Tidy happened. Nlu kept calm in this crisis.
support,A solid and candid Wikipedian who should administrate nicely; should probe more deeply before assessing a situation however. Good luck! 
support,Would benefit from being able to push the delete button himself instead of filling up [[CAT:CSD]]. I've speedied a lot of articles he's tagged over the past few days and can't recall seeing any that didn't meet the criteria.

support,after getting to the bottom of it all but note that IRC is not Wikipedia. 
support,He's not one already? [[user:Celestianpower|Cel]][[WP:ESP|e]]
support,&#8766; Thought he was an admin. → 
support,if he's not an admin he should be one. 
support,I usually look for a minimum of three months here but NSLE is a fast learner. I've seen him everywhere; he knows what he's doing and will make a great admin. 
support,I sense that [[WP:CIV|the force]] is strong in this one. 
support,Per all of the above.
support,I know him! I know him! Great user assumed he was an admin just because I was too lazy to find out if he was or not. 
support,Good User 
support,Good janitor give him the big push broom! 
support,Handled the EddieSegoura incident quite well. Definitely worthy. 
support,good editor. 
support,I was also quite impressed with how he dealt with Eddie 
support,great editor. 
support,Seen him/her around on IRC frequently. 
support,That's hot. 
support,Copyright vio ok Mike? [[Paris Hilton|Miss Hilton]] will see u in court. N.E way . 
support,Seen this user around before. 
support,Good antivandalism work should use mop well. 
support,Handled things very well with Eddie. 
support,Good vandal fighter in training. 
support,Some very high quality edits and being a vandal fighter without sysop isn't fun (I'd like to see your rv edit summaries be rvv when referring to vandalism but the rollback function should help). Despite short term already a familiar face. 
support,Good work. 
support,Good contributions. One minor concern I have is that almost all edits in the project namespace are for AfDs or RfAs. Branch out a little... 
support,I'm frankly amazed at how much he's done here in such a short time. Being a bit of a tropical cyclone enthusiast myself I've seen much of his work and it's good stuff. I also know him from outside Wikipedia and while I'll freely admit that we've had our differences on occasion I also know that he is well suited for the job. 
support,He's acted like an admin whenever our paths have crossed. He should stop pretending. 
support,per nom.
support,of course. 
support,My watch stopped that's why I'm late support.May the Force be with you! 
support,awsome guy! 
support,NSLE is a good editor.

support,Good contributor.

support,Every contrib that I've seen from him has been quite good. 
support,how come I hadn't seen this one? 
support,[[Wikipedia:Esperanza|ε]]
support,per above 
support,Absolutely. 
support,I suppose Even though you left the harsh "Screw you" edit summary on Wikisand and blocked me I have found it in my heart to support you here.

oppose,because Candidate is A. Already going around and thanking users for voting on his RfA prior to it closing which I find to be poor form and B. actually using a template to do this and C. Not even bothering to type a user's name in but using <nowiki>{{PAGENAME}}</nowiki> instead <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Karmafist&curid=909787&diff=30659779&oldid=30649077>. I know BD2412's already going around and thanking users but it at least seems like he's bothering to personalize each comment he makes as opposed to just importing a templated form letter. I know this is probably being anal and nitpicky but I feel administrators should have a strong understanding of policy civility and especially "wikiquette" and to me such actions make me question the latter pretty heavily. 
support,I guess I must support as nominator... | [[User talk:Flcelloguy|A note? ]]</font color>| 
support,Too cute nick to oppose. Of course thats not the reason. 
support,Excellent RC patroller. I see his name numerous times when I am on RC. 
support,good work. 
support,Strong I have never once seen a reason not to make Nufy an admin and many reasons in his valiant constant editing and reverting and reasonableness to make him one. 
support,User page vandalized 68 times? o_O Give this guy a mop already. 
support,It is my opinion that users who receive that much vandalism deserve to have their pages protected. It's not "unwiki" because a userpage is no place for that riffraff; take it to the talk page. 
support,meets . Good luck! [[user:Celestianpower|Cel]]
support,Certainly. 
support,Tireless vandal fighter who would only be more effective with an adminship. Everything that I can see in his contribution history suggests that he is humble and levelheaded. I have no reservations. 
support,Provided he doesn't talk about [[WP:IRC|Harry Potter's sex life]]. 
support,Excellent vandal fighter. 
support,While I don't think I've seen you in action after reading your answers and looking over your contribs I think you'd make an excellent admin. Good luck! 
support,Good responsible editor. 
support,Absolutely support. I see him all the time on RC patrol; he reverts vandalism very quickly. And how could I have awarded him a [[:Image:Flail01.png|vandal whacking stick]] and not support him? 
support,For reasons that have already been mentioned 
support,[[User_talk:Jayjg|(talk)]] 21:42 24 August 2005 (UTC) Edits indicate admin powers will be put to good use.

support,Cool. 
support,Happy vandal hunting!

support,that's almost 80 times now his page has been vandalised 
support,Good RC work. 
oppose,2400 edits in all of 9 months. That much too small for the long length of time.
support,Enthusiastic support. Was about to nominate him myself; thanks for allowing me to cast the first support vote. Nv8200p has put tremendous effort into [[WP:IFD]] listing dozens of images each day and now we need his help dealing with the resulting backlog. ;) I have reason to believe that has made a lot more than 3000 edits in the image namespace since most of his recent edits in that namespace consist of adding <nowiki>{{</nowiki>[[Template:ifd|ifd]]}} tags to image pages and those edits are lost and not counted when an image gets deleted. 
support,</sup/><p style="fontfamily: Bradley Hand ITC Comic Sans MS;">
support,I see this username pop up often on IfD doing the dirty work. Give him the mop. 
support,Nv8200p's name is all over the IFD page. 
support,another easy decision. 
support,No question here automatic support. 
support,I'm just jumping on the bandwagon.May the Force be with you! 
support,not come across him myself but seems like an excellent editor who will make good use of admin powers. 
support,He deserves the WikiPower . 
support,good editor seems strongly committed to janitorial tasks. 
support,Um yeah 
support,Yep tireless image work. 
support,sure. 
support,Your help on [[WP:IFD]] will be appreciated. Just remember not to delete images you nominate. 
support,looks like a worthy candidate.

support,Would prefer 15000 edits but what the heck. . 
support,Major support This is the first time I can honestly say "I thought he already was one...". Anyone else with me here? 
support,Wholeheartedly. Oleg is an applied mathematics postdoc at UCLA who has made many excellent contributions to Wikipedia. He has been a tireless contributer to the [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Mathematics|Mathematics project]]. He created and has been one of the principle authors of the [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style (mathematics)|Manual of Style (mathematics)]]. He was a cofounder of the [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Mathematics/PlanetMath Exchange|PlanetMath Exchange project]] setting up the original lists of PlanetMath articles for that project (nearly 4000 articles) creating an automated conversion tool as well as contributing significantly to the content review and merge work of the project. He is a Perl magician and is the creatorowneroperator of the bot who helps to maintain the lists: [[list of mathematical topics]] and [[list of mathematics categories]] and in its spare time periodically spellchecks all the math articles on Wikipedia. He will make a great admin.

support,Sensible nomination. 
support,Very strong and experienced candidate. 
support,of course. 
support,an excellent member of the set of mathematics editors.

support,Good amount of time a ton of work reasonableness and I can count to 20 if I take off my shoes!

support,[[International Talk Like a Pirate Day|Shiver me timbers]] I thought he already was one! 
support,Will make fine admin. 
support,Usually I stay away from politics. And I think Oleg will have enough support not counting mine. I just want to show my appreciation for what he has done so far. I'm sure he will do greater things as an admin. (I thought he was one already. 
support,Exceptional and dedicated user will make a fine admin. 
support,Tons of work all of it good plus he has a handy bot that makes [[WP:AFD/Old]] a more pleasant place to hang out.

support,Same thoughts as everyone above. 
support,I was thinking of nominating him myself. Someone beat me to it. 
support,Another fine user that I see all over the place. 
support,without reservation. Has in a short time made himself an indispensible member of the WP mathematics effort and one of the few admin nominations I've looked at where it's clear that the conferring of adminship powers will be put to use (and naturally in a way that benefits WP). 
support,Seems to be a good user might as well support. 
support,So! You are the owner of ! I guess I have no choice but to support! 
support,The good stuff. 
support,Looks good to me. 
support,Seems fine to me. Vandal fighting is a perpetually unfinished task. 
support,Sure. 
support,All the right reasons. 
support,Indeed positive motivation. 
support,Looks fine to me. 
support,Cool. 
support,Also please see [[Wikipedia: Village pump (proposals)#Power Users|Village pump]] for a nonadmin rollback function proposal. 
support,There can never be too many vandal slayers. The vandal bots are getting totally out of hand. Also the support of each and every one of the above users is good enough for me to offer up mine. 
support,Long stable history of good contributions. 
oppose,All the wrong reasons. I can't see granting adminship for selfdescribed personal convenience. 
support,pending acceptation by the nominee. 
support,Strong I've seen him working on the Bucharest pages [[Treaty of Trianon]] [[Vienna Diktat]] and others... He is fit to be Admin. He has a very good potential and we all admire his sytle. 
support,he seems to have good temper 
support,[[Image:Flag_of_Europe_and_Austria.svg|20px]] 
support,He's done a lot of good work on Romanian topics and I think he would make a good admin. Eventempered; can distinguish where he is expert where he is merely clueful and where he's out of his depth and act accordingly; etc. Slight hesitation about breadth of experience in Wikipedia but nothing that actively worries me. In the event that he doesn't make it at this time we should renominate in a few months. 
support,why not? 
support,ditto.
support,BTW I like your username. 
support,Extremely good and hard work on [[Romania]] related pages. I'm particularly impressed with [[Culture of Romania]]. We need a good Romanian admin. 
support,Vandalfighters get my vote. We need as many as we can. 
support,Contributions look solid.
support,looking good... 
support,Very Strong He is a romanian. His contributions are very good. We need him.
support,We need more ops with knowledge about Romania. 
support,We can always use another steady hand at the wheel. [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,I have seen his work and appreciate his patience. He is all fit to be an admin. 
oppose,<del>. We don't need more admins. Most vandalism that lasts longer than a few hours would not have been reverted even if every Wikipedian anonymous or not had the rollback feature.

support,I know the feeling when it comes to those new pages. 
support,Seems levelheaded to me. 
support,Fine user. 
support,I love the sound of an admin who will actively delete rubbishy new articles and nonsense. I spend a lot of my time policing things for [[WP:SD]] and would appreciate an admin who could reduce my workload there. 
support,I've seen some of his edits extremely dedicated wiki 
support,support on the condition that he talks to [[WP:WSS]] first before creating any more stub templates! 
support,support
support,I've had nothing but positive experiences with Oven Fresh. 
support,SUPPORT. 
support,I'm satisfied with the responses he gave to my questions. 
support,I am positively impressed with how calm OF has been throughout this process and with the humility grace and honest introspection he has exhibited here. 
oppose,I'm afraid I must oppose. There are just too many things minor on their own which together make him an unsuitable candidate for now at least. Despite being here for a respectable amount of time he seems not to have fully got the hang of how things work here (he has an inflated edit count by his own admission). Look through his talk page archive and just about every other message indicates a failure to work well with others or a failure to follow policy. Not suitable for adminship at the present time. I would consider supporting a nomination sometime in the future but not yet. 
oppose,Weak Oppose. I am just not comfortable with the tone of some of Oven Fresh's interactions with other editors. I think that he is still on the steep slope of the learning curve and gaining speed so I expect to be happy to support a few months from now. This sentence is a speculation so should be regarded as such: I think that the source of the discomforting behaviour may be impulsiveness. 
oppose,Agree with Trilobite. 
oppose,Oppose for now. Some overly sardonic edit summaries like "rollback buttons piss me off" <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Cvgstub&diff=13527018&oldid=13526095> and "Removed bitching added reply" (it was on his talk page I don't feel like finding it right now). There was also a weird exchange with which you can see mainly on <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:ExplorerCDT&diff=7407072&oldid=7406951 this diff> <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:ExplorerCDT&diff=7407477&oldid=7407359 this one> <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:ExplorerCDT&diff=7407773&oldid=7407616 this one> and probably several others. So maybe another time. 
support,as nominator. 
support,[[Image:Symbol support vote.svg|15px]] Extreme Phroziac support! (
support,Even tells me the time when he'll be on RC patrol to help out! 
support,Most certainly. 
support,good editor. 
support,although the low number of edits given the amount of time he's been here is a little surprising. But I really liked his answer to the question about conflict resolution. 
support,a few contacts always positive. rvv'd my user page with a rollbacklike edit summary tricking me into thinking he already was one. 
support,[[Image:Symbol support vote.svg|15px]] Extreme pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcaniconiosic support!

support,great RC work and NPOV AfD contribs. Only request that you review [[WP:CIVIL]] due to a few edit summaries like get with the program buddy!. It's not an issue per say just some could find it offensive and become very defensive before they even look at your reasons or comments. Other than that full support. [[Special:Contributions/Who|∞]]
support,OwenX would make a great administrator. I was impressed on how he weighed in on the [[Synergy/DE]] Afd debate. On this issue a particular user working as a marketing rep for a technology company was posting POV articles about her company and then refused to cooporate with other editors on creating an unbiased article. In a letter to the user's [[User talk:Sde|talk page]] OwenX clearly explained the implications of that article and how it can be rewritten in a form that is acceptable to Wikipedian standards. His actions in this matter have given me confidence that he'll play a fair and consistant role in protecting Wikipedia from commercial exploitation. 
support,[[WP:ESP|e]]
support,Solid user. 
support,1800 edits is plenty enough to confirm that an editor is serious about improving Wikipedia. 
support,Great job on the RC patrol. [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,1800 edits is good enough for me. 
support,EXTREME DEATH TO EDITCOUNTITIS SUPPORT!! 
support,damn editcountitis. 
support,Furry Alien the above comment about his use of a specific string to add to the temporary "blacklist" impressed me more than his answers to the standard questions. 
support,Huhum definitely. 
support,have come across him several times and always found him accurate and helpful. 
support,Got me on the right track. Seems very helpful and nice.
support,in hopes of a editcountitis vaccine. And because he'll be a good admin. 
support,Seems to be knowledgeable and active. 
support,This is a rational person with an interest in the smooth functioning of Wikipedia: exactly what is needed in an admin. 
support,Cool. 
support,although I've had no personal interaction with Owen by his edits he strikes me as a good person and a valuable editor. 
support,For all the good reasons cited above. I love the consistent use of edit summaries in every namespace as they are an easy courtesy to provide for those still on dialup and those who don't want to load every single page to get a feel for what's changed. 
support,A fine editor and plenty 'nuff of them. 
support,is there a pill you can take for editcountis? 
support,Keep this article... Erm I meant support! 
oppose,OwenX appears to be a friendly person from what I can observe but 1800 edits is just too green for me. I will gladly support him in the future once he has more experience should this first nomination fail. 
oppose,been here for a long time but only 1800 edits that's way too little for being on wikipedia so long. I have over 1000 and I've been here for a few months. Maybe if they worked harder in a few months I'd actually support. 
oppose,sadly not enough of an edit history yet to show user interaction conflicts how will this person react to an in their face assholish vandal? or an ignorant newbie who trashes their "pet article"? Needs more time and more edits IMO. 
oppose,Oppose. Too few edits never have encountered this user. 
support,Obviously. 
support,I would have bet that you were already one! 
support,One of the best contributors I know. He'll also make a responsable admin. 
support,Yep. 
support,Yessiree. 
support,I like the minor vandalism comment. :D

support,If the nominator is not around to add the first vote it is not my problem !
support,because I forgot to sign the last RfA. 
support,Checks his watch am I this late!? 
support,Strong because I was just wondering if Pamri is an admin or not; because he put me on to India related links; because his persuasion made me work on the telugu stub of "Economy of India" and because he appreciated my extensive copyedit of K. M. Nanavati article. Most importantly despite the number of edits to his credit his edits per page are less than 1.8 it means that he covers a wide area of Wikipedia folks!! 
support,Havent worked with him much but has made good contributions to Wikipedia. All the best 
support,The lack of content on his user page worries me but the number (~3700) placement and quality of his contribs looks solid. I also trust the nominator. 
support,Although the user page (or lack therof) might seem a little worrisome I think it's better to keep it simple than to load it with too many pictures and too much nonWikipedia information. 
support,unlikely to abuse administrator tools. 
support,sounds good. 
support,Good contributions very happy to see the high image activity. Should be even more useful to WP as an admin. 
support,lack of content on userpage is no reason to oppose. 
support,per everybody else.
support,(but agree that an admin should have an inviting user page). 
support,Freshly created Wikipedia admin seeks new Wikipedia admin to keep him company help fight vandalism talk about funny stuff and the like. I like long walks on the beach and erm...

support,Looking through her contributions I see highquality work and I think she'd be a good admin too. 
support,Obviously not evil I support. 
support,User and talk pages show us an editor who communicates well and works well with others. 
support,Over 2000 edits talk page looks good great vandalism fighting history (some of which can't be seen since page move vandal redirects have been deleted) always courteous on talk pages. Two thumbs up from me. 
support,Looks very good to me. 
support,Valiant vandal vanquisher. Vote: Vupp... erm... support. 
support,This looks like adminship material to me. 
support,Meets my standards for granting adminship. 
support,Why not? [[User talk:Smoddy|(t)]] [[Special:Emailuser/Smoddy|(e)]] 
support,I've been following Pharos' trail of stellar articles related to New York City long enough to know that I should support for adminship. Good luck! 
support,Pharos is civil willing to discuss and listen to other views cares about supplying references for edits and reading other people's always cares about accuracy and would be a very trustworthy admin. 
support,Looks good. 
support,His talk page indicates he works well with others and he was courteous in his communication with me. . 
support,Good luck. 
support,Definitely. 
support,Looks like another good admin on his way. 
support,Doing useful things 
support,strongly. Pharos is a shining example of adminship and its candidacy. (Sorry pun intended.) 
support,Absolutely. 
support,Me of course 
support,A horse is a horse 
support,He's not an admin yet? 
support,he has 4 cats how could i possibly oppose? (good editor as well) 
support,I like the sort of passive admin picture you've painted in your answers. All too often I see an admin start blocking people the same day they are promoted. I can't imagine you ever abusing those powers. (Not that newlypromoted admins are abusing their powers by jumping right in. I just think it'd be a good idea if they sat back and watched the older admins at first). 
support,from what I've seen civil and by his question answers looks reliable trustworthy and a good admin in the making. Open and shut case. 
support,I can't think of any reason either. 
support,since then and still not an adm. ? 
support,Very fine editor. 
support,His contribution history shows a willingness to take on thankless maintenance tasks (well not completely thankless since he's getting this RFA). Give the man a mop! 
support,seems like an editor who will make good use of sysop rights. 
support,Extreme ultra support. Beyond any question or doubt Phil is qualified Phil is trustworthy Phil is perfect admin material. 
support,I agree with the bit about the cats. 
support,everything I've seen has been great. 
support,Though four cats are not really enough. 
support,Of course. 
support,For a user that was welcomed on my birthday ;) Good editor. 
support,as per Func. 
support,Cool. 
support,he's been here like forever! 
support,Happy to support. All my contact with Phil has been positive. 
support,Seems to be calm and levelheaded. (It also doesn't hurt that he's contributed to the <http://harrypotter.wikicities.com Harry Potter Wiki>! ) 
support,[[He wasn't one already?!?!?!|Cliché]]May the Force be with you! 
support,an excellent and more than qualified contributor. 
support,He isn't one already? I thought he was and a good one too. 
support,This should be no big deal. 14:19 14 Apr 2005 (UTC) To elaborate further on my support: I am happy to assume good faith. 
support,Conditional support the condition being that Phils learns how to spell "responsibility" 
support,I'll add to the virtues already described that Phils is a useful and helpful FAC voter and that s/he gets my extra selfnom points. Edit summaries are important though I hope s/he gets into a 100% habit of them real soon.
support,A bit borderline for me but constant activity since October good interaction in Wikipedia namespace and an overall good breadth of contributions to various areas. Nobody's yelling at him on his talk page (though it is a bit thin) and he's not afraid to point out when he was wrong (question 3 below). 
support,I've not personally interacted with Phils before but looking at his contributions he seems impressively dedicated and quite capable. 
support,I can see no reason why not. The user seems friendly getting on experienced and crucially prepared to admit where he is wrong. 
support,Sure. 
support,Good user. I don't consider the "no edit summary in the past" to be a problem. As Oleg Alexandrov said he's done a good job with it lately. 
support,Sure why not? 
support,Less than 2000 edits is a bit on the thin side but plenty of activity on the Wikipedia namespace and good work otherwise compensate nicely. 
support,Why not? 
oppose,Mild oppose. All edits should have edit summary especially those on generic topics. I would also welcome more contributions outside games as the admins could get involved in anything. 
oppose,oppose for the meantime. with so few edits i don't feel i can get a real grasp of Phils' style and personalit.y 
support,as nominator. Good luck. 
support,Looking through his edit contributions and judging by his character I'd say Philwelch would be a great admin. 
support,because he's holding a gun to my head he'll give me a vote when I do an rFa because he's an all around nice guy and more than deserves to be an admin. 
support,! Rather nice chap.
support,Strong Will make a great admin . 
support,Seriously thought he was one. 
support,Sure go ahead not a big deal. 
support,Have seen good things from him. 
support,Phil is one of my favorite Wikipedians! 
support,I was considering nominating him myself. 
support,Cautious Good guy but one specific thing (which I don't say neener neener) keeps me from strong support. [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,Speculation does not an oppose make. We are in dire need of RC patrol. 
support,No milk today ta. But could you deliver a pint of semiskimmed yoghurt on Thursday? 
support,I wish I knew all of the admins then I wouldn't feel embarassed about thinking he was one already. [[user:Celestianpower|Cel]][[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]

support,Um weren't he already admined? 
support,Hipocrite's arguments below seem a little bit imbalanced. 
support,Thought he was one. 
support,That's hot. 
support,I've seen good work from this editor and have faith in his ability to handle the responsibilities of an admin. 
support,with no comments. 
support,Certainly. 
support,after having a somewhat extensive discussion with the editor (refer to the Comments section) I have changed my mind and believe that he is deserving of sysop rights. 
support,I see no problems worth laboring over here except that words a NOT inherenttly POV. The word Terrorist has valid NPOV applications. 
support,support you mean he wasn't already an admin? [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,I've seen good work from him. In addition it seems that [[Template talk:Suicide]] reached a compromise mainly because of him. 
support,Lots of good edits longterm contributor.
support,The hero of [[Template:Suicide]] due to his leading (perhaps sole) role in brokering a compromise solution that looks like it made everyone go home happy. 
support,( 
support,Reasonable bold highquality editor. The edit war people are pointing at seems to have been very minor and resolved satisfactorily. Incidentally it's not a showstopper for the nomination but please use more edit summaries. [[User talk:Rspeer|r</span]]>

support,He really helped the [[Template:Suicide]] dispute/discussion come to a satisfying conclusion with everyone pretty much happy. (I honestly didn't think it would end so well!)

support,100% edit warring and reversions are part of the learning experiences in Wiki. The important thing is that the person learn from his mistakes as I did. I trust in the judgement of Linuxbeak 
support,See no real issues. 
support,I thought this user was already an admin and I thought he was a good one.
support,Cool. 
oppose,"engaged in edit warring and thoughtless reversion" 
oppose,in light of the disconcerting edit warring discussed above. 
oppose,per above. 
oppose,I recognize that sometimes there can be a lot of contention on Wikipedia while editing but I found some of the dialogue [[Talk:7_July_2005_London_bombings/Archive4#Why_is_terrorist_NPOV_.3F|here]] to be a bit less measured as it could have been when the editing took place. 
oppose,He has made some good contributions however due to his constant habit of getting into edit wars I don't think he should be an administrator just yet. I would however have no problem supporting in the future if he can stop edit warring. 
oppose,I thought finally someone with some backbone. Then digging further it looks like his backbone came from being in the majority.
support,NOT just because username sounds like [[Prozac]]. 
support,However I suggest you remember the difference between IRC and the mailing list... 
support,Um YES! 
support,She's the kind of admin I wish I had been when I was her age (oh wait they didn't even have the web then and wikis were only invented in ...). Anyway I hope this endorsement doesn't attract a lot of oppose votes (oh no she hangs out with who?). 
support,She's not one already?! 
support,another one in a long line of candidates I thought were admins already... 
support,I have known Phroziac in person for some time now via IRC and also via her contributions on the wiki. She is a conscientious pleasant intelligent editor who has made a high level of contribution to the wiki in a comparatively short period of time. I am sure that Phroziac shall make excellent use of admin tools... and... I'm amazed she isn't one already 
support,For being an excellent Wikipedian and having a username that sounds like Prozac. 
support,Phroziac knows what she's doing she knows how to do it and when and she's got a lot of wikiexperience already. We need admins with the right balance of everything.[[User_talk:Robchurch|Talk]] |

oppose,Sorry and no offense as I'm sure you're a great editor but I feel it is important for admins to have experience adding content and have experience in the ups and downs that come with that in order to be able to do much of the job effectively. It looks like you'll get enough support though so you won't miss mine . Adding an answer that I'm sure you knew wasn't what I was looking for but you were honest anyway does raise your stock in my book so I'd be happy to support in the future given some consistent content addition.

support,Just his paragraph below about the name wars convinces me. 
support,Sure. 
support,Piotrus's response in the Polish/German naming war is admirable especially considering it was his hometown and he could legitimately be expected to have strong feelings on the subject. Anyone who can handle that kind of thing is clearly admin material.

support,100% [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,Looking good.
support,Fellow aviation buff 
support,Normally I'd be happier if there were more behindthescenes edits but what there are look good. There is a slight tendency to use purevotes on AfD which is rarely helpful and a lack of edit summaries in many places which is unhelpful and should be improved as a matter of urgency (right now not after the RfA). The point about only recently starting to tag speedies but asking for the ability to execute them is also slightly concerning so please tread carefully. But the good contributions and no demonstrations of exploding when under pressure or in disagreement are nice to see. Then there's the length of service. It's hard surely to be around for that length of time and not just 'pick up' the way things work and to have managed to conceal any dastardly plots or personality traits. 
support,user has been around since 20041215 (10+ months check) has 2982 edits in all namespaces (2000+ edits check) seems to be proschool and has at least 1 FA. I simply can't find any grounds to contest this nomination keep up the good work!

support,Given his other activity the lack of article edits is no problem for me. Psy guy has also kindly reverted vandalism on my user page (from an anon I reverted myself :D). I'm convinced his adminship will serve the community. 
oppose,He seems to eager to please will he be able to go counter to the admin culture of deference to other admins when it is the right thing to do?

support,11000?! Give him the mop AND the bucket. 
support,Whaaa? ! 
support,{{rfa cliche}} 
support,how come he's not already? 
support,deserves to be an admin. 
support,Strong Great work on VfD/AfD and related topics. Suprised he wasn't one already actually. 
support,Continue to be brilliant R. fiend!!!! (and yes all of are met) 
support,Smerge. [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,Exactly the kind of administrator we need more of. 
support,A little brusque but certainly nothing to be concerned about. R. fiend has always struck me as evenhanded and I have no doubts about the candidate's fairness. Always insightful at AfD/VfD. 
support,Hearsay does not an oppose vote make. 
support,I hate editcountitis but surely one with 11000 edits could be an admin. Go ahead and get the powers. 
support,Very active in VFD AFD et al. 
support,Just the kind of editor who deserves the proverbial mop bucket and bulldozer to keep garbage out of Wikipedia. 
support,Sure very high edit count knows his way around does plenty of community service. 
support,Strong I'll forego the cliched comments. It's all been said. 
support,After 11000 edits there are bound to have been some conflicts but he appears to be a good editor who is undoubtedly ready for the admin tools. 
support,Those of you who have a problem with the phrase "cry me a river" give me a break. 
support,Sometimes you've got to be cruel to be kind. 
support,Could occasionally do with a bit less deletionism but overall someone who would use the admin tools wisely. 
support,That he can be snappy on deletions is no reason not to recognise that he'd be fine with the mop 
support,as per most of the above sentiments. 
support,for reasons that should be obvious given my own level of AfD participation. 
support,he's a bloke with clue. 
support,! He's been here a while knows his way around and has legitimate concern with building a great encyclopedia here. Adminship is long overdue for a user like him! 
support,Smerge I mean support. 
support,After looking at his edit summaries R. fiend seems thoughtful and thorough. The arguments made below that he should not be an admin because people disagree with some of his specific opinions on articles doesn't make sense: admin tasks are not the same as editor tasks. The standards for an admin are "will they contribute to admin tasks" and "will they abuse admin privileges." "Must agree with my personal positions on editing content such as article deletion" is absolutely a novel requirement for adminship and while people are free to oppose an adminship for whatever reason they want this seems like a particularly petty rationale. I see absolutely no sign that R. fiend will abuse his authority and every sign that he will be responsible. Give him the mop. 
support,holding the opinion that Wikipedia articles should meet some kind of reasonable standard is not evil. 
support,Although I'm... disappointed... that R. fiend's contributed to [[List of songs by name]] I've liked a lot of his contributions by which I mean things like developing smerge and impressing me at a great many Wikipedia namespace pages. 
support,On when responding to Hurts new editors with rough comments about articles. gives the response Cry me a river. Also hangs out at VfD a little too much. Closer inspection.... support 
support,Although some may not like his forthrightness I believe that R. fiend will be a good admin and will not allow his personal opinions to get in the way of judging consensus. I also agree with Proto's comment above. 
support,A person can make substantial edits and be a good admin and for whatever it's worth the point that he was making with "cry me a river" is one we ought to consider: if a new user makes a mistake and gets on VfD then we should be as nice as possible. If a new user tries to game the system tries to holler his way to a "keep" or tries to play the "I'm just a blushing flower whose soul will be crushed if this is deleted" then we ought be quite unconcerned. Anyone who will fold after a VfD whose petals will be crushed is not going to manage very well in a place where no one gets to own his or her own words. We don't cease to be a wiki or an encyclopedia because of the subjective state of the authors and editors. R. fiend has been exemplary in trying to make the system better (working on deletion reform working in policy trying to solve edit wars and conflicts) as well as the encyclopedia better (writing as well as voting contributing as well as tinkering). This is what we look for in admins. 
support,on balance. I've looked at the specifics within Xiong's objection: at several (though not all) of the diffs he considerately provides. While I see things that could have been done better I see nothing there that alarms me. I've read Owenx's objection: it has merit but for me it's not strong enough. There are already some gruff administrators (even dare I say it bureaucrats) and the pedia is the better for them. Polite explicitly expressed consideration can take a lot of time; all admins have to make some effort but not all must be very good at this; a certain degree of gruffness is OK if it gives more time for people like Rfiend to do more good work. So Rfiend should be given mop and bucket together with advice to slow down a little not much but a little. 
support,seems would make a good admin. 
support,on the grounds that I've actually heard of him. 
support,strong contributor to wikipedia 
support,Can't believe that I missed this RFA... 
support,[[International Talk Like a Pirate Day|Yarrrr!]] an expert at [[WP:AFD|swabbing the poop deck]]. 
support,strong contributor 
support,I don't know this candidate but voting oppose at this point would be useless. 
support,we always need more vandal fighters.
oppose,This is a tough one. R. fiend's actions are correct: he reverts when something has to be reverted he marks for CSD or nominates for AfD when the article warrants such treatment. I also share many of his opinions about the VfD process itself. However being nice takes time and R. fiend's terse approach can be seen as overly militant scaring away newbies and adding to an already elevated atmosphere of animosity on AfD. This terseness also manifests itself in his Edit summaries as mentioned above. Very few editors are capable of productive work at the rate that R. fiend has demonstrated in the year and a half he has been with us but a good admin needs to be courteous not just efficient. I am sure he will never misuse his sysop powers but creating the appearance of power abuse can be very disruptive to the community as well; after all we have to remember we are dealing with an army of (mostly) wellintentioned volunteers not chairing a courtmartial. I am sure R. fiend can change his manners to appear less confrontational and once he does that I'll have no hesitation in supporting his promotion. 
oppose,New content creators however misguided should be welcomed. I don't want to empower editors who do not have that view. Also whatever your personal views on edit summaries several users have shown a great deal of upset at those who don't use them. It only takes an extra moment so I think disregarding those users is not acceptable. You're not just a deletionist by the way. You are a rather unpleasant pisstaking deletionist just the sort of thing that makes the AfD pages a bit of a cesspit. 
oppose,This user has been extremely hostile to me on VfD before and seems to be one of our most radical deletionists. 
oppose,for the reasons clearly articulated by OwenX. 
oppose,for now Although R Fiend has the editing credentials... I dont think he has the personality for it he's a tad too hot under the collar at times (and if anyone would know about that its me). At this juncture i'm going to have to go ahead and oppose however I think its possible he may improve by his second nomination. 
oppose,no support for deletionists and their destructive agendas. 
support,Forshizzle. 
support,apart from anything else Humanbot is absolutely amazing. 
support,Enthusiastic collaborative editor who seems goodhumoured and reliable.
support,But of course. 
support,[[That's hot]]. 
support,Nothing but good experiences while working together on the [[Wikipedia:Cleanup Taskforce]]. In my experience he's dedicated to making Wikipedia better. · 
support,Kudos to the janitors; they keep the place running. 
support,Strong As said is a devoted member and a driving force of the [[Wikipedia:Cleanup Taskforce|Cleanup Taskforce]]. He would be a fine addition to the ranks of admins. 
support,Absolutely. 
support,this committed Wikipedian with extra points for the selfnom and for nice mature handling of Trilobite's concerns on this page. 
support,R3mot shows substantial commitment toward Wikipedia and making him an admin will help him with developing even better tools to combat vandalism which those of us who do that need more and more every day. It would be counterproductive not to support. 
support,Neutral and tending towards oppose. See comments section for my concerns. ([[User_talk:Trilobite|Talk]]) 12:37 23 Jun 2005 (UTC) Switch to support. 
support,even if Humanbot sometimes [[User talk:Humanbot#Thread mode articles|edited what it shouldn't]]. 
support,Yes yes yes! Echoing Kelly Martin. 
support,Demonstrated strong commitment to improving the quality of Wikipedia. 
support,I'm with Kelly's comments. 
support,Thought he was one. 
support,despite use of l33tsp33k in username. Give this man a mop. 
support,Duh. | [[User_talk:Linuxbeak|Talk]] | 
support,A strongly committed janitor who would benefit WP greatly with the admin tools. 
support,Humanbot is great asset and so is its creator. 
support,support an excellent contributor to wiki 
support,support Very good user and I think he'd make wonderful use of admin powers. I seem to remember working on one of his projects but I can't remember which. Oh well. Strong candidate. 
support,support Nice jobs. 
support,Good editor no indication will abuse admin powers. 
support,I like bots a lot; brings the automation and sophitication we will undoubtedly need as the project goes mainstream. [[User talk:RoyBoy|Boy]] 
support,Plenty of good maintainence and cleanup work which would greatly benefit from admin tools. 
support,among other things because I'm the nominator. 
support,All together now: I thought he was already one!. 
support,with the greatest pleasure. Would have nominated him myself if I hadn't thought he already was... 
support,Radiant! is a valuable Wikipedian who I feel deserves being entrusted with the provebial mop and bucket. 
support,Very Strong Great work all around relating to VfD in particular. 
support,A very impressive amount of work in a short space of time. 
support,Very Strong Radiant! is a very sensible user who will will make a great admin. 
support,A strong choice in my opinion. 
support,Looks good and I think we need admins who aren't afraid to deal with controversial issues. | [[User_talk:Linuxbeak|Talk]] | 
support,Seems like a good chap. 
support,Radiant! takes part in policy discussions and seems a generally trustworthy sort. 
support,Everyking's endorsement convinced me. 
support,Some of Radiant!'s edits are unpopular sure but that's part of being bold. 
support,Emphatically support. 
support,Awww... I got here late again. The oppose votes surprise me; in my experience he's always made a goodfaith effort in contributing. 
support,Admins will necessarily become involved in controversial topics on occasion. Radiant! has had some practice in advance. On a more serious note I do not foresee him (mis)using the admin tools to further any argument so there isn't a problem with giving him the keys to the mop closet. 
support,will make a good admin. 
support,Definitely. Anybody who Everyking hates must be a good guy. 
support,"I thought you were already an admin!" &#9786; . 
support,Ditto the above. 
support,Heartclutchingly bold indeed but we need a few people like that. (Just a few though!) I don't agree with everything he does but I believe Radiant! will continue to be bold admin or not and won't abuse the extra powers to further his position. 
support,This should be no big deal. 
support,Knowledgeable in cleanup and deletion related matters. 
support,Has addressed my concerns below. Thanks! 
support,Very good at bringing the dregs of Wikipedia into a coherent whole. 
support,We've disagreed on some issues but Radiant! is unquestionably a very valuable contributor. 
support,support 
support,good user good contributions to policy discussions. 
support,Not sure. Perhaps a little too far into the "pushy" beyond the "bold" stage and too quick to jump to decisions but does some great work too. [[User_talk:Jdforrester|(talk)]] 23:04 31 May 2005 (UTC) <br /> Having see Radiant!'s recent amazing efforts on [[Wikipedia:Schools]] I've decided to vote in favour. . 
support,didn't I already do this? :S 
support,Highly commendable for working hard to resolve differences with certain people. 
support,I thought I voted yesterday. Getting absent... uh oh yeah minded. 
support,My experience is that R has bent over backwards to accomodate others rather than "rushing to judgement". Entirely sensible. Votes against are quite instructive. 
support,All [[human|persons]] with known [[Heart disease|cardiac condition]] people with [[pacemaker]]s [[pregnancy|pregnant women]] and small [[children]] are [[advice|advised]] to [[edit]] with [[Warning sign|caution]]! [[WP:BOLD|BOLD EDITOR]]</big> coming through! The first of a [[innovation|new]] [[research|improved]] [[breeding|breed]] Radiant [[searchlight|lights our path into the future!]] (And he's a decent editor too.) 
support,this fine fellow. 
support,Though we had somewhat different viewpoints on the school issue Radiant I and others worked together towards a compromise which Radiant very diplomatically outlined at [[WP:SCH]]. Though he is bold in asserting his mergist principles I've found that he's willing to discuss differences of opinion and I would hope this would continue when he becomes an admin. 
support,Weak although it may be a concern that hes a strong deletionist and may be too quick to delete articles. 
support,We need strong leaders iron men with iron wills.
support,strong editor. 
support,My contact with him has always been positive. His handling of others is always for the good of wikipedia. 
support,I thought he was one already. I think he certainly will be able to handle the increased responsibility. 
support,! 
support,I thought he'd been hardbanned? (Well not really but it beats "I thought he was one already"). 
support,I was put off by one or two support votes (especially 's) but they were balanced by some of the oppose votes and Everyking pushed me into support (actually it's at least as much a matter of his contributions record etc. but that would have been boring). 
support,There was a little naivette in the past but Radiant's views seem judicious in general and I fully support. 
support,When voting I rarely take into consideration who supports or opposes a candidate. However this is one of those rare instances. 
support,I'm going to use the overused: I thought he already was one! 
support,(my first ever vote on RFA). The oppose list makes me more inclined to vote here. 
support,Sensible reliable good communicator. 
oppose,Weak Oppose Radiant is a nice guy but he is at times too quick to rush into judgement and take things personally and has overly strong deletionist tendancies. I am also not impressed by the hounding of who in my mind embodies the wikispirit. While in do think Radiant would be a good admin I worry about his judgement in relation to VfD which is one of the most visible roles of an admin. Too me the fear information loss outwieghs any concerns of an avalanche of cruft.
oppose,Emphatically opposeattitude completely unsuitable for adminship. Based on what I've seen this user say I think we could expect controversial deletes and blocks on a daily basis. 
oppose,Although I think that has been a valuable contributor to the Wikipedia I have also seen an inclination to rush to judgement on some issues. For the time being I am not ready to hand him the keys to the Wikipedia mop closet. 
oppose,I've seen too much where this person has acted against common practice performed major actions without explaination or regard for requests to slow down/hold back and is quite prone to edit warring. If adminship is about trust I would have to see some major improvements. I would suggest he spend a considerable amount of time working back on the main encyclopedia. 
oppose,This user frequently edits policy and process without consensus (and in my opinion to further an agenda). This is a gray area and I admit I sometimes do the same. But I wouldn't support myself for admin and I can't support this user either. I find it significant he has felt compelled to defend himself here; ideal admins do not seek the office. We need cooler heads to hold the keys. [[Special:Emailuser/Xiong|&#29066;]][[User talk:Xiong|talk]]
oppose,a while ago i was noticing this user tagging/redirecting a lot over at [[Wikipedia:Deadend pages]] which is fine but unfortunately a lot were done incorrectly such as adding multiple stub tags and for example redirecting [[Guardian's Office]] to [[Scientology]] when scientology made no mention of the redirected topic. i know these are fairly pathetic examples but i remember encountering a lot of them. I would never hold anything against anyone but it frustrates me to see any recklessness. 
oppose,Although this user is a good contributor but am not sure that I can support him as an admin at this point. 
oppose,Does not meet 
oppose,because Radiant <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Radiant%21&diff=14791249&oldid=14783740 deleted the discussion of TFD votes> after Netoholic cited it as an exhibit. 
support,I support Ragib's nomination. 
support,positive experience over long period of time. 
support,Ragib. 
support,I have seen most of his major edits. My interaction with him was always dynamic. I am sure that he will be a good administrator. 
support,Absolutely. Ragib deserves Adminship! 
support,Cool. 
support,Though I haven't known him for long in the short span I've interacted with him and viewed his edits I can vouch for his neutrality and interest in improving subcontinent related topics. 
support,Deserves to be an administrator 
support,I think admins who specialize in certain areas are important. I nominated a person for Philippinerelated article so it's appropriate for one who does Bangladeshrelated ones. 
support,Strong editor whose been here a while. 
support,This user is not a vandal. (Not to mention that I had pleasant dealings with him at [[Talk:Pakistan]] but that's just icing.) 
support,I wholeheartedly support the proposal. 
support,Sure thing. 
support,Aside from his other great contributions Ragib has also done some work in welcoming newcomers. 
support,Looking at his contribution history he seems to be more than qualified for adminship.
support,That's hot. 
support,Active in reverting vandalism and tagging new images. 
support,I would generally say that Ragib's a good guy and thats all I care about. Bob Dole supports this user. 
support,Excellent contributor and will be an equally excellent admin. 
support,Suppport. Great editor who does a good job I'm sure he'll do a good job as an admin.

support,this dedicated contributor. 
support,no prob. 
support,Rama's a great editor and a nice person always reasonable sticks to policy cares about neutrality fairness and using good sources and is always civil. 
support,Considering it occured to me the other day that maybe I should nominate Rama how could I not support? A great Wikipedian: friendly constructive trustworthy etc. He will make a good admin. 
support,Good artist 
support,Generally appears to be a solid contributor. 
support,I particularly like "Coming soon: more group sex" on his userpage. 
support,A quick look at his contributions talls me Rama is a great Wikipedian; a glance at his user page tells me Rama is also probably a great person. :p 
support,Cool. 
support,Rama is just what we need. Great editor hard worker notably polite and conscientious hand him the mop and bucket!
support,Very civil great contributor. 
support,After looking around his stuff I find his contributions very impressive; I suspect he will be an excellent admin. 
support,Seems to be a very conscientious editor and clearly more Hindu deities on the mop cadre can only be a good thing. 
support,I was considering this but Kim beat me to it. 
support,We need more like this. 
support,&#8212;
support,I like the pictures. ;) And I am amazed that anyone could be so compassionate in so many languages. Ahem; I am merely extrapolating to the more than four other languages am I not? 
support,He has all the qualities we need in an admin and more. 
support,Very much so. 
support,Have been watching Rama's ability to work calmly with others. 
support,Great contributor great candidate. Trustworthy and knows what collaborative editing is about. 
support,lest he draw embarrassing caricatures of us. Naw just kidding; he's got what it takes. 
support,In the interests of clarity yes most definitely! 
support,A valuable contributor. 
support,Yupyupyupyepsirooney 
support,"better late than never" so goes a saying so being so far behind in this sequence does not worry me. I would love to see an administrator knowing so many languages.
support,A name I'm familiar with and associate with solid edits intelligent comments and a polite demeanor. Excellent admin material. 
support,Will make an excellent admin. 
support,My pleasure. 
support,Generally good use of edit summaries some antivandalism work. I'd have liked to have seen a wider range of articles worked on but perhaps that's just me. 
support,Remarkable editor who undoubtedly will accomplish great things here regardless of the outcome of this. 
support,Wikipedian of the year. 
support,absolutely. Adheres to policy very civil to others a model Wikipedian we need more like him. 
support,One of the good guys. 
support,strongly 
support,Apoyo con mucho gusto [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,Of course. 
support,Great editor. I trust him and the opinions of him expressed above. 
support,oppose votes are nitpicking (as is their right) nothing gives me pause in my support opinion 
support,[[WP:ESP|e]]
support,Good editor calm and reasoned helps provide balance by bringing Palestinian position to articles. 
support,Weak support Though I read some opposition about his lack of interactivity I still see Ramallite as a special contributor to the Middle East and [[:Image:Applelogo.png|20px|]] articles. 
support,Absolutely. &#8212;
support,with pleasure. 
support,Stays remarkably civil considering the contentious nature of many of the articles he edits. 
support,Opposition is almost entirely spurious. Keeping away from Wikipedia namespace is a plus and 250 articles is a very broad contribution. Besides if Klonimus opposes you you're probably doing something right. 
support,I must note that we've had a fair share of disagreements but Ramallite had always shown an ability to compromise good humor and good faith.&larr;
support,I now make it twothirds in favor. 
support,Strong Ramallite's [[User talk:Ramallite|talk page]] along with the fact that several people who disagreed with him previously are now supporting him show that this is a user who is capable of constructively discussing controversal issues 
support,Good sensible editor (notwithstanding his personal page). 
support,This should have nothing to do with his politics/world view 
support,and I really like his answer to question 4. Do we expect editors who have a science background to write only about the arts? 
support,Good editor with ability to discuss heated topics. 
support,Displays mindboggling ability to remain calm in the face of adversity. 
support,support Usually I would vote neutral due to insufficient edit count (my ruleofthumb being at 15002000). What is swaying me is (a) support from people I respect (b) the support he is getting from the 'other camp'  so to speak something all too rarely seen in IsraeliPalestinian affairs and (c) the fact that I wish to set a counterweight to what I consider unfounded oppose votes below. 
support,Polite and calm stays cool when editing heated articles. 
support,Excellent editor on controversial topics; Wiki namespace participation is irrelevant. 
support,seems able to maintain NPOV in difficult areas. 
support,Many difficult topics suffer from a lack of disinterested people who can edit and administrate in a way that works towards consensus. I hope that Ramallite can help the project. 
support,An intelligent articulate and composed editor who will make a fine admin. 
support,Changed vote see below.[[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e</u]]>
support,none of the oppose votes make me think he'll abuse the tools. [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,Slightly qualified . My only question is about amount of experience. I am certain he'd be a good admin and I'd take the chance on a little onthejob training. Any POV issues should be completely laid to rest by the support from Jayjg and especially Guy Montag who are (respectively) largely and diametrically opposed to his views on Israel/Palestine and who have worked extensively with him on articles in this subject matter area. If we cannot get consensus now please let's come back to this in a month or two. 
support,Excellent choice. 
support,The cadre of WP editors needs to be diversified as much as possible.
support,though I must comment on the user page where it states: "I view a person's choice of using a Mac versus a Windows machine as an indication of that person's intellect." The thinking man chooses Linux and the guru one of the BSDs. 
support,Anyone who can successfully get both sides of the Israel/Palestine freefloating flamewar to approve of them is way too dangerous will probably follow up by squaring the circle and must be supported. Er hold on I'll just come in again 
support,I'm as impressed as dab and David Gerard by the approval coming in from the freefloating flamewar. I encourage everybody to read the Oppose votes below I think some of them can only work in the candidate's favor. 
support,There is nothing in your contribution log or your user page that troubles me Ramallite. I do think Sarah jumped the gun a bit by nominating you so early. After another month of good editing you'd have sailed through with much less opposition. It's not that an editor needs an enormous amount of experience to learn not to abuse the admin tools it's just that it takes much more effort to evaluate someone with fewer edits. In your case I find that your calm response to the opposition you've got has tested your mettle enough to say that you will use the admin tools with the most important admin quality of all restraint. Your comment below that there aren't any special admin powers seals the deal for me. Good luck. 
support,Calmness and courtesy are better indications of a person's fitness to have the extra tools than number of edits or length of time here (within reason of course). 
support,The more good editors the better this becomes. 
support,Keeping [[WP:COOL|cool]] here suggests to me that will make a reliable admin. 
support,The opposition is utterly unconvincing. Ramallite does good work and keeps a cool head. Why's everyone trying to make adminship into a Big Deal? 
support,I support for four reasons. 1) Ramallite appears a good editor. 2) I trust the judgment of many of those others who have supported. 3) Ramallite's contributions here have been impressive. 4) I disagree with voting on account of political opinions onwiki or off. 
support,Deserving. 
support,His contributions are constructive. He is knowledgeable about the subjects he contributes with and plays well with others.
support,See comments for reason. 
support,Strong This is a very kind and polite wikipedian who had cooperated with me on recording several Hebrew and Arabic audio prunounciations for Israel/Palestine related topics. 
support,Although Ramallite has a relatively limited editing history his contributions have been extremely professional and polite even when addressing politically contentious topics. 
support,Changed vote from oppose. Ramallite is bright knowledgeable polite and calm. And he might find a cure for cancer which would be nice. 
support,I wasn't familiar with this user previously but in this case I find the stark contrast between the case for supporting and the case for opposing persuasive. Opposing based on mechanical criteria (time distribution of edits etc.) is perhaps understandable even if I don't care to substitute such measurements for my personal judgment. But for many of those opposing based on "POV issues" Wikipedia would probably benefit greatly if these folks continued shouting into mirrors while leaving the disputed pages to the diverse viewpoints of the crew above. 
support,Cool. 
support,Seems extremely civil and relaxed with a good understanding the Wikipedia "philosophy" so to speak. And I agree with the above vote: "And he might find a cure for cancer which would be nice" :> 
support,if only for his ability to bring civility and enforce NPOV on Palestinerelated articles. 
support,Most of the oppose votes are there only because the editors don't agree with this user's personal viewpoints. 
support,Looking at Ramallite's history I think he will use the tools wisely. While I might like to see a little more Wikispace participation his work on "New Pages" and "Recent Changes" doesn't make him any less worthy than editors who have a large number of edits on AfD. There are lots of different needs here and no one needs to try to cover everything. 
support,I'm mystified as to why would spam my talkpage with a suggestion that I look at this RfA but I'm kinda glad he did. Looks like an excellent user whose edits despite his strong personal POV have attracted praise from all sides of the political spectrum. I have no qualms about adding my support to this RfA. 
support,Good user that I've seen. 
support,as above. [[user:Celestianpower|Cel]][[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,Willing to extend trust to someone who can edit hotbutton topics and still remain civil and productive to work with as it appears this user can. 
support,on perusal of userpage edits and so forth I'm quite impressed. In fact extremely impressed. 
support,( 
support,by all accounts fair meticulous and unflappable. 
support,Reactive support. If I'd come upon this RfA as one of the first few contributors I'd have certainly voted oppose or neutral at best. Small experiance outside namespace and a provocative user page would have made me cautious and as becoming and admin is effectivly oneway I'd have trotted out the old "in a while" chestnut. However this editor appears to have reacted with considerable grace under pressure. Policy can be learned fairly easily a cool head is harder to aquire. 
support,At first honestly I almost instinctivley opposed the nomination due to Rammallite's user page but the fact that he has shown nothing but strength of character and reason in his posts shows me that he is levelheaded intelligent and rational enough to become an administrator furthermore the honesty he has exhibited on his user page proves to me he has no ulterior motives as it would have been much easier to not reveal his politics at all. Ramallite is a true model for correct wikiquette. I will however say that although I strongly disagree with some people's methods and ideas on this page as a new user myself I do think they have every bit of a right to vote as long as they are not sock puppets or anything. 
support,while the comments on his user page honestly make me sick this user has been known to make only good NPOV edits recently. 
oppose,Wiki namespace participation just isn't there. Twenty one in the main space and nothing in Talk. Also a relatively high edits per page avg. of 4.5 means that just two 250 distinct pages editedthis is much too low for me. Edit summaries are there and the quality of edits are good so will certainly support with more experiece. 
oppose,Please get some familiarity with Wikispace and its processes before considering adminship. 
oppose,Although I'm sure he'll make a great admin soon I agree with Marskell that I'd like a bit more experience to be certain of this user's judgment. "Bettersafethansorry" vote here. 
oppose,Needs more time and interaction. (Seems like a good guy though 
oppose,per NormanEinstein. 
oppose,per others. 
oppose,POV issues and a general lack of maturity and experience in separating personal veiws from article content. I just don't think that Ramalite does anything that needs admin powers. 
oppose,POV issues unexperienced needs more time to prove himself before he should be considered for admin. I'm also skeptical because there appear to be many POV pushers and persons who are prone to cliqueish admin behavior supporting him. Admins should have proven adherence to consensus building and neutrality in disputes and many giving testimony in support do not have those qualities. 
oppose,Weak oppose Not enough edits on wikipedia namespace. Really you should hang out in [[WP:FAC]] [[WP:FPC]] [[WP:PR]] or even in the RFA page you get to meet loads of people and really get to "experience" wikipedia as a community. The stuff they do there may seem like chores at first but eventually I think you'll like life in the WP community as much as life in the WP encyclopedia (heck I hardly edit articles anymore given the time I spend on WPspace I find [[WP:AFD]] a little scary myself but you might like going there as well. I'd support with 100200 edits in WPspace and it's not too difficult. Experience WP to the fullest! 
oppose,POV issues unexperienced. Ramallite is a nice guy but proven that he has no ability to detach his own POV on the IsraeliPalestinian conflict from editing wikipedia. There are subjects (such as abortion and the mideast) who cause most edit war in wikipedia. To make a person with such attachment to one side an admin will be a mistake. He has tried to insert pure propeganda material as "facts" into his edits. 
oppose,Strong Oppose PoV warrior (have you read his user page?) little experience. 
oppose,Not enough edits on Wikipedia namespace. 
oppose,per others. 
oppose,I am not comfortable in voting to give admin rights to a person who has edited less than 300 distinct pages I prefer around 500. 
oppose,Absolutely NO! User page comments such as "The Israeli checkpoints and restrictions on movement are an unfortunate necessity to protect Israelis against suicide bombers" along with an "answer" which basically calls the Israeli position a lie is scurrilous aregumentation at it's worst and de facto proof of antiIsrali bias with intention to stoke discord. Never. Not today. Not tommorrow. 
oppose,AntiIsrael bullying should not be rewarded. And to comment on something I see happening on this page: Just because I may often agree with a particular person on the contents of articles does not mean I necessarily have to agree with them on who should be an admin. Aren't we each entitled to our own opinion on each issue? 
oppose,I don't trust the judgement of those who are pushing him for this position so soon. We know about as much about him as we did about Harriet Miers. How will he deal with admin abuse for instance? Has he been around long enough to have experienced it?
oppose,POV. Ramallite would have to be a saint to be objective on Palestine/Israel issues but he isn't a saint and most likely will not become one. 
oppose,not convinced he won't be pushing POV after being promoted. Since we don't have an easy procedure for deadminning it's better to be on the cautious side. 
oppose,POV: His mild critique of the Arab side never approaches the level his rejection of Israel's position. 
oppose,. The statement Ramallite added "Although the Israeli government has said that the purpose of the barrier is to prevent attacks and that any hardship to Palestinians is an unfortunate side effect made necessary by terrorism the barrier's opponents say the barrier is the de facto future border of the State of Israel."<http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Israeli_West_Bank_barrier&diff=25278732&oldid=25222179> shows he cannot check his bias at the door. The word "[[although]]" implies contradiction in this case that the purpose of the barrier is indeed a de facto future barrier (first statement is false because last statement is true). It's a little Freudian slip and indeed is hard to notice and many editors might pass it off as neutral while others will notice the POV but not be able to point it out. This mistake obviously could have been accidental on his part (he makes no secret of his biases). However considering the numerous complaints here it sounds like his own bias accidental or not is a large problem that he has difficulty coping with so I oppose his nomination on those grounds. 
support,Unconditional support. 
support,I've seen a lot of good contributions from over a long period of time. I am glad to support. 
support,I think Redux will be a trustworthy and friendly admin. He (or she) made a lot of edits. And the edits are very high quality.

oppose,Redux has shown too much undesirable traits to be trusted with any power over others. I remind that he has not even promised anything about refraining from admin actions on behalf of "his friends". His own admissions already say much about his past behavior and there has been no apologies from him to persons he insulted or abused then. Redux has sometimes but however repeatedly made personal attacks and used abusive foul language. And Redux has repeatedly made accusations of sockpuppetry when he must have understood that there were no more than one username in use (he then tried to fabricate an allegation of another username baselessly). Redux has shown himself a possessive nature one of the examples is him putting a WIP tag into an article keeping it days (also continued when reminded that the tag is intended for only 30180 minutes not longer) and reversed a valid edit by another when such had been made over half a day after Redux' installation of WIP tag. Redux has even shown some paranoia and certain querulous nature. (Wonder if anyone would really give him admin powers here after all such behavior.) 
support,Overwhealming Enthusiastic Unequivocal [[Are_You_Being_Served#Characters|And I am unanimous in that!]] 
support,agree completely with nominator. 
support,Absolutely. I agree with everything Essjay said about this fine contributor. The welcoming of newbies is particuarly impressive. 
support,A mop would certainly complement that Vandal Whacking Stick. 
support,I am new to Wikipedia but as soon as I signed up...bang there was Red with his kind intro message letting me know this is a living community. Keep up the good work. The more active this becomes the better the resource. 
support,Suppport 
support,Not sure if to support or oppose I don't vote neutral as a matter of some ludicrous principle or another. 
support,Definitely Yeah I saw his contributions and it is nothing but a bunch of wonderful work of music. I sure do like getting some information. He and I both have the same work I do work of music articles too. 
support,seems to be a very good editor and is great when it comes to welcoming newbies. 
support,I've decided to support you since you do seem to be a good editor and have made many contributions. 
support,While I'm new Red has was right there to welcome me and provide me with a wealth of information helpful to my WP quest. I'm also impressed with his contributions! 
support,responsible polite and hardworking in my experience. 
support,Good member of the welcoming committee good editor deals well with trolls and his talk page seems to be a discussion hub for Wikipedians. Everything needed in an admin.
support,Does a good job reverting vandalism very friendly should be a good addition to the staff. 
support,A very clear choice I think was considering nominating him myself but then saw Essjay's offer and decided to just wait and add my assent. Red's dedication to welcoming and guiding new editors seems to me exemplary of what any admin should be willing to do for newcomers. 08:14 16 July 2005 (UTC) HOLY CRAP! a bureacrat said he was gonna nominate me! 
support,Without a doubt Redwolf is a great candidate. and has made a real contribution to wikipedia with everything he does from fostering community spirit to relentlessly improving the integrity of the encylopedia's content and organization. He'll be able to do even more good as Admin. 
support,Completely agree with Essjay... Redwolf gets my vote any day for being so prompt with a welcome for being upfront with clear answers and for being the allround 'good guy' which really shows through even after limited interaction. 
support,Is a diligent cleaner of wikipedia and should be given key to moproom. Can we have round 3 of untagged images now please? (This communication does not constitute a bribe.) 
support,has the busiest talk page I've ever seen almost all with praise and thanks for welcomes. 
support,I know Redwolf. He's very Kind and respects others. Demonstrates exellent wikiquette.
support,As long as you don't stop with the welcoming. 
support,(strongly) 
support,Very impressive record. 
support,I've just started noticing him recently and he's a superb candidate. 
support,A very nice guy I'm sure he'd be a good admin. 
support,STRONGLY He'll make a great admin I'm sure. 
support,Agree with most of the above a nice guy. Plus he plays the geetarz! 
support,Bing! another vote added to the total... 
support,Deserves it gave me a lot of help after joining Wikipedia. 
support,A bit light on the edit count but if current trends continue will outstrip me by the end of the week... High quality edits and from a friendly user who will no doubt make an excellent addition to the admin team. 
support,partly as a belated thankyou for reverting vandalism on my userpage last night. 
support,no good reason not to. 
support,Friendly face on RC Patrol. Always good. 
support,Fairly new but great work all around. Friendly and with strong community spirit. Great admin material! 
support,Yes he's new but he already has over 2500 edits and I've seen a nice collection of newbies that he's welcomed. He seems like a great editor and a champion in not biting newcomers. His user page is a good laugh too and it shows him to be an approachable person; that is an essential quality for admins. I'd like to see him get more involved with WP: stuff as I notice only 159 edits there but I don't think that's enough to detract from supporting him. 
support,Anyone who makes it his or her duty to welcome newcomers is deserving of the responsibility of an Administrator. 
support,I must vote yes and I seem to remember RedWolf saying "If you do not vote for me I will take power!" (Any [[Ali G]]/[[Borat]] fans out there??) 
support,Strong overwhelming support This issue should not even be an issue. RedWolf Administrator now. 
support,Nice guy and does good editing work especially on music articles. He'll make a great administrator. 
support,Seems like a knowledgeable and kind Wikipedian. 
support,This seems quite the ideal candidate. 
support,He gave me lots of help when I first joined WP 
support,wholeheartedly (as if my voice is needed as well!) Definitely one of those "meh no big deal"/"you mean they aren't already?!?" promotions. Seems very outgoing and overall a really nice guy. The only criticism I could possibly make is that I don't see many edits in the Wikipedia: namespace. I think that's an important part of being an admin as it lets you learn what's what. No biggie though you can also learn by just reading instead of taking part. Now lather up well we'll give you some floors to scrub in a minute! 
support,What a friendly helpful Wikipedian! 
support,a worthy and helpful candidate. 
oppose,and I feel miserly for doing so. However I do not think that someone who has barely participated in VfD (by their own admission in the questions) or TfD CfD etc (let alone places like [[WP:AN]]) and implies that they don't really know the extent of what admins do can be an admin yet. Evidently hasn't done much RC patrol to try getting on the wrong side (accidentally!) of a few users and handling that. More participation in adminny type things so that you are more familiar with more ropes and I'd be happy to be less miserly. I don't really think that rapidwelcoming of newbies makes an admin...but that's evidently just me. 
oppose,I actually recognise this username which is quite impressive considering is a relative novice. I am opposing this nomination because I feel that there is insufficient data on which to judge the candidate. All but 100 of 's contributions have come in the last month. I am not comfortable supporting someone based on a month's worth of contributions nor am I comfortable supporting someone who has only been a regular contributor for a month. was absent for the whole of May and made very few contributions in April. While his recent enthusdiasm is really impressive it's not enough to demonstrate a trend of responsbility and trustworthiness. Moreover less than 700 of 's contributions have been to articles. I'd like to see some more involvment in actually building the encyclopedia. I must oppose for now but in a few months I would be very willing to change my vote. 
oppose,3 months is not enough. 
oppose,I'm kind of sorry to oppose but while this user show enthusiasm he has been a regular for only about a month. I do concur with Ace's comments above. Take your time. 
oppose,as pointed out above the user has only been active for the last month. Needs more time to get exposed to stuff admin should know about like deletion transwiki copyrights and all the rest of it 08:16 20 July 2005 (UTC) I definately know more than my share on copyrighting now. As for deletion thats not like a basketball skill or anything theres nothing that persay knows how to do at VfD's that I do not. As for Transwiki I'll admit I don't know how to do that. 
oppose,Weak . I value civility strongly when voting for admins. I believe that having friendly admins is very important. However <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Boobsquish&diff=prev&oldid=18988864 this edit> is an example of him showing unfamiliarity with Wikipedia processes. I feel a little more time would help him understand a bit better. 04:11 21 July 2005 (UTC) yes I was talked to about that it was a very n00bish mistake of me. Forgive me 
oppose,I think he could use a bit more time to settle in. 
support,Please use the preview button. Great user however so support. 
support,Seems like a good user. 
support,Great user works fairly on controversial subjects and is cool under pressure. 
support,Seems to make good edits and is able to work well on controversial subjects. 
support,I remember you from a long ways back from an edit war (involving [[Azerbaijan]] IIRC). I also remember you working well under those conditions. that you would make a good admin. 
support,Seems OK. 
support,If anything the discussion between k1 and refdoc as far as I can tell reflects well on refdoc. I support this RFA 
support,Okay I am willing to support now after convincing myself that Amir1's statements are biased and that refdoc has handled the situation coolly. 
support,Tentative support: I've seen this user's name come up in page histories and he/she does appear willing to engage in discussions on difficult subject areas: an essential quality for admins. However I haven't had time to conduct a thorough browse of their edit history so cannot comment on what other voters have written. 
support,A person's personal beliefs do not factor into my decisions concerning RfA's their conduct on WP is what matters. Refdoc's manner of handling disputes speaks highly of his character knowledge of Wikipedia policies and willingness to abide by them. of course. 
support,After consultation with other users and reading more of the disputes he has handled I feel I can support him. 
support,After taking quite a bit of time going over the available information I feel confident that I can vote to support. A good admin is not necessarily one who avoids controversial subjects but one who can handle them appropriately. Refdoc will be a fine admin. 
oppose,For the reasons below. 
oppose,His history speaks for itself. He uses Wikipedia to promote his brand of Christianity. Such people by defintion cannot be fair and unbiased although it is natural that they will do their best to hide their intentions and agendas. 
support,Seems like a decent editor dedicated to making Wikipedia a better place. I've had/seen no problems with him. 
support,Having checked his past contributions I think he is a hardworking editor appropriate for the admin job. 
support,though I believe that you could use a bit more Usertalk namespace edits. 
support,He's very hardworking and has shown himself willing to do the difficult and tedious work all over Wikipedia not just on a single topic. I've had to delete wikiproject pages that he'd finished up and I always thought it was odd that he didn't have the ability himself. He should. 
support,Works on double redirects and encyclopedia topics. Spots suitable AfDs. No adversarial encounters AFAIK. What more can we ask.
support,does grunt work. 
support,Seems like a good user nice work with double redirects which is tough 
support,good editor. 
support,Weak I don't ever give full support to self noms but my main belief is that beliefs should be modified slightly when they don't fit the situation and this is one of those situations. The edit count is more than sufficient despite not hitting 2000 because of the Wikiproject work using CDVF(which is the quintessential admin tool) and the fact that sockpuppets are already opposing him is the clincher. Considering that sockpuppets could be anybody there is a chance that Reflex could have made the sock on his own(seems unlikely)to gain some more support from people like myself who dislike sockpuppets but even if that's true i'm gonna [[WP:AGF]] and say The Karmafist believes if that was true The Reflex Reaction should earn extra points for creativity ;) 
support,good editor 
support,He's a dedicated individual and you can't criticize his edit count because he's one the few who uses previews and edit summaries. whole heartedly good luck! 
support,per above... 
support,Wikignomes who do the hard work. Give him the [[Wikipedia:Revert|mop]] and the [[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|flamethrower]]. 
support,Why name reasons when all the above reasons are pretty good? 
support,[[WP:ESP|e]]
support,although I don't know 'em. 
support,I support the Reflex Formatting guy. I like the username because it's real! I believe that would remain true after the upgrade! 
support,[[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]] [[user talk:Private Butcher|Butcher]] s yes [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]] [[user talk:Private Butcher|Butcher]] is making fun of another user's use of 3rd person. So ha! [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]] [[user talk:Private Butcher|Butcher]] in response to you all. 
oppose,OpPoSe Not enough edits for needs a lot more edits for an admin. Atleast over 2000 especially for as long as this dude has been around. 
support,Knows his way around the [[Image:Flag of the United States.svg|25px|<nowiki></nowiki]]> USA too! Has greatly helped me survive possible brutal attacks on Wikipedia. What a guy! 
support,Certainly. 
support,now that candidate has accepted. That yellow blob on the map is not far from my mum too. 
support,Knows his way round Britain and knows his way round Wikipedia too. 
support,Great work. 
support,Why shouldn't I
support,Knowledgeable edits. 
support,Checked the Talk page looks impressive enough for the job. 
support,Assumed he was one. 
support,Looks like a productive and knowledgeable Wikipedian. 
support,fair contributor and I trust the nominator. 
support,As per Sn0wflake. 
support,Per Grutness Sn0wflake and Mel Etitis. 
support,One of the good ones. 
support,Looks to be a great admin. 
support,Good and experienced wikipedian. May the Force be with you! 
support,Supoort. I haven't seen a lot of this editors work but a quick review of the contribs list shows no reason why adminship for this edior shouldn't be "no big deal." The signatures already in this list confirm this is a great editor we can expect great work from. 
support,Been here more than a year has a good number of quality edits. I changed your link on [[Wikipedia:Wikipedians/Iowa|Wikipedians/Iowa]] hope you don't mind. 
support,Absolutely. Excellent WikiJanitorial work. 
support,Great user. 
support,Intelligent and hardworking (thanks for the ntoe about Anthropos by the way I always thought well of both of you so it doubles my support 
support,Looks good! 
support,Cool. 
support,He's been a consistantly good editor for a long time I'm sure he'll be a fine admin. 
support,Definitely. 
support,Great stuff. 
support,A strong user. 
support,! 
support,and insert clichè of choice regarding shock and surprise as to why this guy isn't an admin yet! 
oppose,172 is usually a good judge of character so I'll back him up on this. Also this candidate has a minimal number of edits having only been around 10 months. More experience needed. 
support,Unconditionally. Rick has been here too long and done too much to not be deserving of the mop. 
support,obviously. 
support,Most certainly. 
support,He wasn't already an admin? 
support,About time. 
support,absolutely. 
support,What can I say other than lots of edits not an admin.... ;) 
support,I definitely see some good work from the candidate's part. 
support,Unconditional I was about to nominate him. 
support,Another one of my rare RFA votes but someone who certainly deserves it. 
support,Very much. 
support,Hard working pleasant in discussion gets involved in the stuff admins should. 
support,It's a cliche but its true I thought he was one. 
support,Wellwritten answers + archives talk page + over 1000 edits + over three months experience + nomination from Essjay = ShoeIn 
support,Excellent contributor and long overdue to be an admin. 
support,I usually only vote on the nominations of candidates whom I've had some form of interaction with or at least whose work I'm familiar with which isn't the case with RB but looking it over this candidate's record is impressive. . 
support,Yep. Does good work and has earned a ringing endorsement from a trustworthy nominator. 
support,Time for another <nowiki>{{cliché}}</nowiki>. 
support,Do I need give my reasons.May the Force be with you! 
support,if ever there was a possible case for speedy admining this would be it. Ho w come noone spotted that he wasn't one before? 
support,Let Rick Block vandals. Let Rick Protect the wiki. 
support,[[:Image:KoolAidMan.jpg|Oh Yeaahh!]] 
support,Plenty of good work. 
support,Seen nothing but helpful contributions and lots of them. 
support,on condition the sun rises in the east tomorrow. 
support,Without hesitation. 
support,! 
support,Certainly... 
support,an outstanding candidate.

support,A wonderful contributor to Wikipedia. 
support,you mean he's not one already?!! | [[User talk:Flcelloguy|A note? ]]</font color>| 
support,of course. His name has been around the wiki a lot lately and always doing good things. 
support,Essjay's nomination weighs heavily and you have some real heavy hitters in your corner! 
support,what Flcelloguy said. 
support,Essjay said it all but this list says even more it's like a who's who list of the hard workers here on Wikipedia. Now all we need is boothby to give him support and I think it's safe to say that we could nominate Rick for wikiemperor if Jimbo ever gets tired of the job...
support,without a doubt. 
support,Rick will definitely make an excellent admin! 
support,good user. 
support,for his kindness to newbies and all inclusive demeanor. 
support,Cool. 
support,everything looks in order here! 
support,Though it took him three attempts to get his RfA right I believe that the user has enough edits in all the namespaces. 
support,Go on then 
support,Looks good enough to me. . [[Image:Flag_of_Europe_and_Austria.svg|20px]] 
support,Any admin on another Wikipedia is good enough for me.[[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e</span]]>
support,already being an admin elsewhere show his trustworthiness. 
support,very good editor. I seen you on Simple English as well. Recommended. 
support,doesn't seem even remotely likely to abuse the tools. In regard to Radiant's comments below I assume he'd review the relevant policies if he intended to take admin actions outside of his experience. 
support,I believe that he has enough time to learn the relevant wikiprocesses. 
support,Trustworthy as shown by being admin on Simple English. 
support,Of course. 
support,support a) seems good at working with others on talk pages b) admin should not be such a big deal. 
support,Seems like a good editor and works well with people.

support,I haven't had personal experience with this user but based on the above he's a good candidate. 
support,[[WP:ESP|e]]
support,on the condition he tells me what "RJFJR" stands for. I like his answers to the questions and looking through some of his recent contributions was greatly heartening. Also I have a theory that "Wikignomes" make the best admins ... 
support,I've been impressed when I've seen him in Recent Changes. | [[User Talk:Lomn|Talk]] / 
support,Good RC Patroler

support,I cannot overemphasise the need for friendly users and administrators. 
support,Lots of good work on Deadend pages. 
support,Oops almost missed this one. 
support,Hope I got here in time. 
support,Cool. 
support,Is he a trustworthy member of the Wikipedia community? In my judgment Yes. Will he misuse admin powers? In my judgment No. Hence support. 
support,Seems reasonable to me. But watch those edit summaries! 
support,slightly tentative as I would like to see more edit summaries; also the practice of marking significant edits as minor needs to be exercised with a degree of caution as many users have set their "recent changes" preferences to hide minor edits. Correcting a comma or two adding category or realigning an image should count as minor but adding extra information should not in my opinion. Nevertheless I think there's a lot more in your favour than not so I'm supporting you. 
support,If after more than 7000 edits the only complaints stem from lack of edit summaries and he acknowledges the fact this is an overdue nomination. 
support,Since adminship is supposed to be "no big deal" my only criteria for support are experience and trustworthiness both of which Rlquall exhibits in abundance. 
support,Excellent contributor. Edit summaries and "minor/nonminor" is in my humble opinion a very very very trivial thing. Overdue nomination. 
support,Makes good contributions to local articles and is well knowledged in the history of Middle [[Tennessee]]. 
support,Thought you already were one though. 
support,Cool. 
support,Sounds fine to me. I myself forget to use edit summaries from time to time. 
oppose,almost no summaries for edits. Also why do you ask for admin? I think main advantage of adminship is when dealing with vandals less for edits. 
oppose,Not enough edit summaries. 
support,No big deal :D [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]

It took him just a couple weeks or so to bring it up to FA standard. As Ryan himself mentioned in another RfA we have some great candidates lately.

support,Per above.

support,Strong First off basically has RfA as his main focus on Wikipedia so while his vote might not be as impressive as say a vote from or seeing a Delete vote on [[WP:AFD]] from 
support,because he voted for himself. Everyone has the right to vote on RfA. This kind of thing should be encouraged. 
support,script looks nifty and edit # suffices.

support,a positive user with a fantastic capability to contribute to cleaning (eg:[[Wikipedia:Disambiguation pages with links|link repair]] ideal for admin activities. 
support,[[WP:ESP|e]]
support,Oppose The self voting does not bother me at all it is an honest mistake that many Wikipedians make. Excellent dedicated work on various cleanup tasks these are very much appreciated here on Wikipedia. I would however prefer to see marginally more edits to the Wikipedia and Wikipedia Talk namespace. There are other areas in need on Wikipedia such as [[WP:CP]] [[WP:IFD]] and [[WP:RM]]. Should administrative functions be granted to you by the community would you consider helping out at these places at your leisure? 
support,RobyWayne does great work and as noted he has a very positive attitude. I believe he will make a fine admin. 
support,anyone can make a mistake. It's not clear that you must not vote for yourself. It's like on Afds when it's not clear that nominators need not to vote too (the nom itself is a vote unless explicitly stated) (
support,selfvote is a single mistake among otherwise welljudged contribution. 
support,as per HappyCamper and CommanderKeane. 
oppose,You can't vote for yourself. 
oppose,<S>per Andrevan. Been here actively for only 2 months most edits are either user categorization and disambig so I dont see th need for admin powers. 
oppose,Oppose for now not enough time of heavy involvement in the project 
support,Strong Like I said in nomination I am strongly support his nomination. He's very helpful nice and will help with a lot of things!

support,due in no small part to the handling of the questions below. 
support,What Turnstep said. I for one wouldn't have taken those questions as calmly... [[Image:Flag of Austria.svg|15px]] 
support,I know his good job as a sysop on the Romanian Wikipedia. This argument counterbalances the nominator and the bad timing. 
support,His responses to the baiting probing irrelevant questions below demonstrate that he has the proper temprament for being an admin. 
support,Strongly He deserves this nomination and he can be a real help for the other admins. 
support,He already does a tremendous job as a bureaucrat on Romanian wiki! 
support,Coolheaded user in many hot disputes. I would like to ask Ronline to promise to fill the [[edit summary]] more often though. And about the nominator I suspect Bonaparte's motivation is to have a friend with big stick at certain controversal articles but I don't think Ronline will fall into that trap. 
support,Having not been involved in the apparant conflicts I'm going to side with the majority on this one. This user shows promise and promise should always get a chance to prove itself. 
support,I believe he is fair rational and doesn't resort to ad hominems. I expect him to continue to be so once he's elected. 
support,I don't get why his religion should affect his chances at adminship. [[user:Celestianpower|Cel]][[WP:ESP|e]]
support,Very moderated edits even in harsh disputes. I do not agree with users arguing that the RfA should be rejected because of who submitted it. This is not about but about . 
support,Strong He is the right man for the job! 
support,I don't know the candidate from Adam's Off Ox but no one could fake tolerance and fair mindedness through all the inappropriate questions below. Holy smokes but that takes some equanimity. 
support,Never seen this editor but by studying the contributions I must . 
support,However for the record I would like to show that I am pretty sure that Bonaparte has ulterior motives here. 
support,Seems like a good editor and he did a nice job handling the questions below. I don't really care about the source of the nom since it's not germane. 
support,Ronline's able and commonsense mediation in the matter of the anon Romanian contributor with a prediliction for unjustifiably augmenting Romanian stats demonstrates he's made of the right admin material.
support,Should make an excellent admin. 
support,Excellent job of handling the inappropriate questions below. 
support,per above. 
oppose,. I like Ronline. He is a good person and deserving of adminship probably. But as Zserghei and Iulian U. said the fact that the nominator is Bonaparte makes this request suspect. If this RfA fails (which it probably won't) I would vote "support" in a new RfA later if the nominator's motives were less suspcious. Now if it didn't look like this RfA was definitely going to win I would truly consider a "support" vote because it's Ronline we're talking about but since it looks like it is with or without me I'm just registering my opposition here more as a matter of principle. 
oppose,On the basis of the user to question 6 (which I've just taken the liberty of correcting the numbering of by hand). Please review [[Wikipedia:Protection policy]] and [[Wikipedia:Blocking policy]] fix your answer to be in line with these and I'll be glad to review this. 04:06 27 November 2005 (UTC) Changing to abstain following (iterated) modifications to answer with which I'm now completely happy pending a closer look at candidate's contribs/developing an actual substantiative opinion.

support,[[Image:Symbol support vote.svg|15px]] Extreme Phroziac support! (
support,Certainly. 
support,Adminitrator should be able to administer which is visible in this candidate. WP is not an experiment in anarchy and silence creating noise is destructive in my most humble opinion. We are here to talk and arrive at some consensus and not to talk like deaf and dumb people by gestures and gesticulations these comments are in response to other comments in this voting process. A very strong support. 
support,Good editor with lots of experience showing courtesy and good judgement in my interactions with him. 
oppose,Based on the candidacy presented here I think administrative capabilities will be a good fit with this user's portfolio of skills at a later date. An administrator has more responsibility and more autonomy associated with their account. For example if one "<burns> out quickly" while performing RC patrol without administrative functions I am inclined to feel they would not be used in an as refined and precise manner as they should be when given. There is also a strong sense that critique is not handled as gracefully as they can be. Administrators often encounter situations which require diplomacy and more moderation; some of the responses presented at the moment do not seem to highlight adequately levelheadedness and willingness to learn. Finally there are many situations where one will need to evaluate based on introspection alone without external guidance. For example what purpose did it serve to first use the words "unclean" "dirty" and "wrong"? Certainly they are somewhat intensifying modifiers and their reception and reaction to them should not be surprising. Respectfully 
support,Only just [[WP:ESP|e]]
support,Looks good. | [[User_talk:Linuxbeak|Talk]] | 
support,Always uses edit summaries almost daily edits although participation to AfD has been low lately. Deserves the tools. 
support,been here for a long time and wasn't involved in anything bad. 
support,This edit count inflation is getting out of control. 1600 edits is "way too low of an edit count for an admin"? It wasn't too long ago that 1000 was the magic number then it seemed to rise to 1500. Is it at 2000 now? Not everyone has the time to make 10+ edits a day. 
support,And those with editcountitis can eat my . 
support,damn the editcountitis. 
support,I'd rather have a thousand good occasional admins than a single busy poor admin. 
support,A fine editor with plenty of edits to prove it. Also I strongly support the position of others about editcountitis it may not be fatal but sure can make some for some distorted appraisals. Virtually all of the opposition has to do with edit count and nothing to do with his quality of contribution (except for one who didn't like his comment about edit counts below!). 
support,I had fewer edits and a lower rate of edits per day when I became an admin and find that opposition based on edit count alone to be unreasonable where an editor with 1600 edits is concerned. 
support,The editcountitis below is getting ridiculous. 
support,Good response below 
support,I'm not worried about the edit count. Like Roy I believe the correct measure is the total value of his contributions not the sheer number of individual edits. I was more worried about his selfproclaimed deletionism but I couldn't find a single case where I disagreed with him on his AfD vote (and I did look!). I am not a deletionist myself but I do trust this man with the "Delete" button. 
support,Has shown his mettle in admintype functions. Doesn't seem to suffer from editcountitis! 
support,RoySmith hasn't done anything silly as far as I can see and has shown interest in the maintenance side. I'm slightly disappointed with the amount of material he added to the encyclopaedia (at least in the block of edits that I checked) but we need different kinds of editors and also different kind of admins. On the statistics: he's been here for almost a year and took about 4 months for the last 1000 edits; nothing to alarm me. 
support,Responsible contributor. 
support,levelheaded interaction with other users. Edit count largely irrelevant and I empathise with Safari surprises me with an autofill on the text box! 
support,as a fellow Macuser. 
oppose,been here too long to only have 1600 edits. Should be very active on wikipedia to be an admin. I can't support. 
oppose,way too low of an edit count for an admin. Anyone spending "a lot of time reverting vandalism" as user states should have a much larger edit count. 
oppose,As the nominee said 1600 edits/year. It's a rather small number. 
oppose,Oppose for reasons stated above. 
oppose,for the way he responded to Durin below. 
support,"Nominator was late" support Keep constructing those highway and road articles.

support,Very good contributor. 
support,looks fine to me.
support,unlikely to abuse administrator tools. 
support,oh what the hey.

support,Late nominator support as nom 
support,Has made strong encyclopedic contributions and has done nothing to indicate he would abuse administrative powers. 
support,Suppport very good contributor. 
support,I stumbled into something I didn't like that had been going on in the California State Route Project and found willing to work with me despite the fact that it required major rework on 200+ articles. It's true he works mainly in a specialized area but admins are needed everywhere 
support,As several editors said above this editor is not likely to misuse the admin tools which is most of the ball game. 
support,You know what? I'm sold. as above. 
support,In my interactions with Rschen7754 I've found him to be knowledgeable about Wikipedia policies and conventions.

support,Great commitment to the quality and aims of the project. 
support,fighting vandalism is a chore that he does admirably.

support,We need people such as Sam. 
support,obvious choice.

support,Excellent contributor. 
support,totally. 
support,so long as xe's aware of community concern with the GNAA and mindful of dealing with it there should be no problem at all. An exemplary record IMHO.

support,I've only seen him make good edits and I'll support in light of his reasonable responses to the objections listed below. 
support,Already an admin on fr: which sort of invalidates most of the gloomy arguments against him; recipient of the which hopefully indicates that he is helpful. 
support,I definitely trust the guy for this kind of job and not cause he's also on fr:. 
support,based on his track record on enwiki I sincerely believe he would not abuse a position of privilege. 
support,That's hot. 
support,Excellent work and a cool temper. 
oppose,Accuse me of stereotyping if you must but I feel that his links with the GNAA are of some concern. While I almost hate to suggest it; he could be open to peer pressure from the group once he's "in" so to speak. This is not a personal attack; this is me stating that I'm concerned. Even the nicest people can sometimes succumb to peer pressure.[[User_talk:Robchurch|Talk]] | 
oppose,Friend of trolls admits to trolling (I find goatse a lot less shocking than many other subjects; from a purely sociological point of view it's interesting to see reactions) per . 
oppose,Silsor's IRC logs coupled with Sam's longtime insistence on having an unlabeled goatse link on his userpage do not inspire confidence. 
oppose,I don't like judging people based on their friends but for the best of the community I might have to. How easy it would be for GNAA to peer pressure their admin friend into trolling. 
oppose,not big on the GNAA stuff. 
oppose,I believe this user is too quick to side with blocked users and after a lengthy and unpleasant experience with another user who became an admin and then unblocked essentially all users blocked based on admin judgement I feel I must oppose.

support,Definite support. I've noticed Sango's name all over the place this week including cleaning up my mistakes... 
support,Since I'm a somewhat new user (used and occasionally edited wikipedia when I was anonymous) I needed (and still do need) help. Sango gave me that help. 
support,He She handled the [[Devadasi]] situation very well appears to be a friendly civil editor has sufficient experience and edits significantly across several namespaces. Plus that prism picture he she added as a logo for [[WP:MIND]] was so good I had to vote for it even though I didn't know that page even existed! 
support,Absolutely. Sango has shown familiarity with Wikipedia procedures and puts in a lot of work for imagerelated projects (especially Barnstars). 
support,Very welcoming very helpful seems to have a lot of presence around the site and I'm sure she'll use her admin powers to great positive effect. Keep up the good work! 
support,This user has been contributing for only three and a half months. But when I looked through her talk page I saw that this user treats newcomers to Wikipedia with profound respect and she appears to have amassed quite a bit of trust from the community. She also appears to enjoy improving other users' talk pages. So I will abandon my ninemonth threshold for this vote and support this user's application for adminship. 
support,What the... Denelson voted for you despite that I do all those things (mild jealousy :P) Anyways this user is amazingly courteous and I don't understand why she's self nominating I mean I'm sure many people would've nominated her. Ah well this user is funny nice and all around a great person. Sincerely 
support,Wholehearted support There is nothing that I have found with Sango that I do not like. A great editor and Wikipedia will benefit with a mop in her hands. 
support,I hear nothing but good things about Sango. She is very great when drawing images for the Barnstars and she has been a welcome addition to the [[WP:BAP]] since she first started drawing for us. Unconditional support. 
support,Sango123 is willing capable eager helpful knowledgeable courteous personable assertive and excited about this ongoing project. If Sango123 wants to volunteer I am confident this community will benefit from Sango123's efforts. 
support,Sure. 3000 or so edits since March and I haven't heard anyone complain about Sango123so she can probably be given the mop and shotgun. 
support,why not. 
support,! Sango123 welcomed me within seconds of my first edit giving me information that helped me clear some of the initial difficult hurdles associated with joining this vast community. My only regret is that I did not nominate her to this post.

support,he edits a wide variety of articles and he's a great help on VfD as well. 
support,seems like a fine user. 
support,friendly editor with a penchant for housekeeping. :p 
support,a man that knows what he's doing.
support,I'm impressed by the answers to the standard 3 questions and to the pretty offthewall additional ones. Lack of edits might be a concern (but I'll take quality over quantity) and his answer to the first neutral vote is tellingly true (as long you as you promise the doublenegative was one of the typos!). Does VfD/RC/copyvio and other editing too so has looked around some. 
support,Unconditional support. 
support,This user has shown good evidence of commitment to Wikipedia and has made significant contributions throughout the wiki. A pleasant and helpful individual through my experiences on IRC and through evidence on talk pages. The answers given to the adminship questions below are honest and provide good evidence of this user's intentions to use administrative privileges well. Sasquatch will make an excellent asset to Wikipedia as an admin I am sure. I wholeheartedly support this user's nomination for adminship. 
support,Great user I've never seen him around actually but looking at his contribs hes good. Plus Brandonfarb below needs to be caged. As long as its not a straw man sock you got my vote ; ) 
support,As a matter of curiosity where do you think the sockpuppets in the Oppose column come from? Have you upset someone on the wiki lately or have they just picked someone at random? 
support,Wikifever isn't a reason to deny adminship to you sir. 
support,Nothing wrong with replying to comments. 
support,Strong The trolls and sockpuppets really seem to hate you... which suggests that you're certainly doing something right. Great work on VfD strong vandalfighter helpful edit summaries. Damn fine admin material. 
support,Sasquatch seems like a sensible good contributor and I find the arguments of the opposition patently unconvincing. 
support,I don't recall much interation with Sasquatch which would normally mean my not participating in the vote but I knew I'd seen the name somewhere recently. I was the admin responsible for the protection and unprotection in the Star Wars credits dispute. I was most impressed by the way Sasquatch managed to get the parties talking and come up with a solution that meant the articles were only protected for a couple of days rather than the month that seems to be the average. Combined with superb answers to the questions below and responses to the oppose/neutral votes I am more than happy to vote in support. 
support,Seems to do quite a bit of good work. I also like that there is someone else working on [[Harry Dean Ainlay|Alberta mayors]]. 
support,Good VfD contributor. 
support,the sockpuppets swung it for me. 
support,I have met Sasquatch a number of times notably in VfD and I think he would make a very good addition to the Admin team.
support,I've seen Sasquatch around Vfd and am happy to place my vote here.
support,Sasquatch's work on VfD and vandalism shows he knows his way around the 'pedia and has the admin spirit. 
support,Very fine user. 
oppose,Not nearly enough edits and most of them are very recent ones as if the nominee were "ramping up" for his run for admininstratorship. His comments on this page border on obnoxious.

He is still somewhat new especially by the elephantine standards of some of us but a good pick and he's been very active in his time on project. 
support,good answers. Seems honest straightforward. Good luck! 
support,! Scimitar is really active on Wikipedia VfD's and other community activities which is a sign that he knows Wikipedia policies pretty well and shows himself as a friendly Wikipedian. He also does a lot of muchneeded work and helps out a lot. Scimitar will make an excellent Wikipedia administrator.

support,I've been quite impressed where I've seen him at work. |[[User Talk:Lomn|Talk]]/
support,Full support. Excellent WPn 1300 articlespace edits 1200 WPspace edits one featured article participates in sysoprelated activites including RC and NP patrol good participation in VfD with a display of good sense and an understanding of policy is not "stupid or insane." Unconscionable if he didn't get the keys/mop/broom/other clichéd trope.
support,Good idea. 
support,A very friendly and active user who has a firm understanding of Wikipedia. 
support,for all the reasons stated above 
support,Will be a fine admin. 
support,His patience in trying to deal with is exemplary. 
support,Good humoured and tolerant user. 
support,Good editor. 
support,will make an excellent admin. 
support,fits admin criteria on my userpage. 
support,Suppor Change from Oppose to after more detailed review of user. 
support,Sure. 
support,Strongest possible support! OMG why didn't someone tell me Scimitar was up for an adminship? 
support,Full support. Strong editor helpful and willing to get his hands dirty. Full support. | [[User_talk:Linuxbeak|Talk]] | 
support,You're 19 and you're not alcoholic huh? Oppose then! Only alcoholics can be admins. (Sorry the apparent nonsequitur on Scimitar's user page amused me. if you haven't figured it out.) 
support,Time in service at Wikipedia is usually a very important consideration of mine as I believe one needs a lot of exposure to really know how things work around here (actually I still don't know how things work around here) but I'm going to make an exception for Scimitar's good edits. 
support,Good chap. He's been around just about long enough. 
support,Excellent contributor. 
support,I just don't get the "not enough" reasoning. Not enough against some magic number? It's well enough to make a judgement how good an admin would come out. 
support,Yeah I'm happy with that. Enough time and edits to show trustworthiness. That's all that's needed for me not edit counts and time limits. 
support,you'll make a fine admin. 
support,[[:Image:KoolAidMan.jpg|Oh Yeaahh!]] 
support,I shouldn't let this one get by without my vote especially considering the very rapid growth in maturity as noted by the candidate answer to questions #3 & 4. 
oppose,Not enough time. 
oppose,per Variable and Astrotrain. 
oppose,Too soon. 
support,Seems a responsible and calming editor although I prefer as admins those who do more writing. I like the willingness to explain reverts on talk pages. 
support,Seems like a legit user who has a huge potential. 
support,Definitely. I've seen Scott do quite a bit of janitorial work and the proverbial mop and bucket would be an aid. I'm not too concerned about the oppose votes below: it looks like he's modified his signature and while I think that working on a featured article is a good sign for potential administrators I don't feel that not working on one is a point against them. 
support,Relatively few edits but what is there is good enough. 
support,Great user. 
support,Another name I'm familiar with from his janitorial work. His true edit count is certainly much higher than listed (dedicated New Page patrollers always have skewed edit counts due to marking nonsense for deletion). Seems calm personable and knowledgeable of WP policies. To his credit he prominently includes a declaration of bias on his user page but maintains NPOV edits. 
support,Same reasons as SWAdair above. The comment for ABCD few items up applies as well. 
support,Seems good enough to me. 
oppose,A little short on edits in . Dislike that he [[Wikipedia:Sign your posts on talk pages#Things to avoid|transcludes his signature]] (a burden to server resources). Would give the benefit of the doubt but we don't yet have an [[Wikipedia:Requests for deadminship|appropriate process for removing adminship]] in case he's not ready. His work so far seems good so maybe in a month or two. 
oppose,As far as I can see does not meet my 
support,Strong as nominator.

support,a very worthy consideration for adminship. 
support,Looks good. 
support,a level headed editor should make a good admin.
support,More than happy to . He has been an active contributor to Australian articles.

support,Fine candidate will make a good admin. 
support,See no reason for concern here. 
support,I've witnessed ScottDavis' rise to glory over the past year or so and his contribution to Australia related content is awesome. He displays leadership characteristics in his discussions which evolves Wikipedia postively by inspiring those around him. An inspirational candidate. 
support,Dedicated and responsible. 
support,I've found him to be a very levelheaded editor. Also the more Aussie Admins the better! 
support,not so much a case of "thought he was one" as "want to know why on Earth he isn't one are you people asleep at the wheel?" 
support,What he said. 
support,Edit conflict and timeouts Grr. 
support,[[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e</u]]>
support,After reviewing his contribution log and reading his answers to the questions I can support without any reservations. 
support,(First!) SCZenz was a terrific editor during [[ATLAS experiment]]'s FAC; I've seen him nowandagain since and have always been impressed. 
support,(Second!) I know about SCZenz edits as I also contribute to physics articles. From what I've seen I think that he is able to act in a neutral way and diffuse conflicts. I'm certainly not supporting him just because he is a physicist. I would e.g. never support for this position because of his frequent conflicts here.
support,In my experience pleasant to deal with good communicative skills and certainly knowledgeable about physics. 
support,A fine editor to work with who really put a lot of effort into his FAC. (And I enjoyed the [[OopsLeon]].) 
support,why not. [[Image:Flag of Austria.svg|15px]]

support,Good editor 
support,support 
support,I've interacted with this candidate on various occasions. Has been civil and rational even when dealing with unsavoury characters. 
support,Excellent reasonable editor. 
support,Good contributor. 
support,Good work so far. 
support,Very Good User... don't know if I still can vote though but if I can then SUPPORT. 
support,I've seen Seabhcan at work on numerous occasions and I never noticed anything that would make him unworthy of adminship. .
support,Seabhcan has been an excellent and worthy contributor to Irish articles & has been great to work with. 
support,From what I've seen he's been an active contributor and pretty much controversy free 
support,Cool. 
support,Keeps his nose clean and has been around for ages so we know he's trustworthy. Even if he can't think of specific admin tasks he'd tackle right now (question A) I see no reason not to give him the tools even if they're only used on an adhoc basis. 
support,A great editor who deserves the no big deal title of admin for his work on Irish matters alone. The humour apparent in his responses to the generic questions reflects his ability to deal with stress well. 
support,Adminship should be no big deal. Even if he rarely uses admin powers it wouldn't hurt for him to have them. It's not as though they're rationed. 
support,I don't see why not. 
support,I'd be more enthusiastic about this adminship if Seabhcan was but he seems solid enough.
support,Levelheaded user doesn't stir up controversy useful contributions on Irish topics. 
support,A review of some edits user page and talk page all look good. Seems like someone who works well with others. Should be no big deal in this case. 
support,Far less qualified candidates on this page are getting twice as much support. I can't find a good reason not to support this candidate. 
support,No big deal. 
support,He seems quite qualified for adminship. 
support,Actions speak louder than words. His actions speak of adminworthy material. 
support,I don't know Seabhcan but an apparent good record and a lack of problematic edits would lead me to think he/she could certainly be trusted with adminship. 
support,He/She is a good editor and deserves my support. 
oppose,Weak oppose. A longtime contributor with many edits with a pretty clean history (going by user talk history). However lack of activity in the Wikipedia namespace and nonanswer reply to question 1 suggest a lack of interest in admin duties. 
oppose,Weak oppose. I agree with Gwalla's comments and feel that while you fulfil the requirements experiencewise for adminship. However users should not become admins just because they feel they've gotten to a stage where they need to be seen as a sysop. If you want to be an admin convince us!

support,Calm and rational. 
support,as a fellow troll. 
support,All my personal interactions with him have been positive his answers below make me believe he'll use the admin toolbox responsibly and we need more admins. It's an open and shut case. 
support,this user is unlikely to abuse administrator tools. 
support,Yup. 
support,Blimey I haven't stated it already. 
support,per nom.
support,This user will never ever be an admin while I'm here. I guess I'll just leave then . 
support,cool person (or so it seems ;) 
support,good record will be a good match for the job. 
support,A fine fellow deserving of the office.
support,Lookin' good ;> 
support,Hayupp. A little low on the articlespace edits but editcount ain't everything so everyone keeps saying. Has shown good skills since he's been here so I'll add my scrawled X in the plus column. 
support,no objections from me. 
support,Should handle admin duties with aplom. 
support,I've seen him in action; he'd make a good admin. 
support,Per nom. Good record
support,Yes. Exceptional newcomer an asset to Wikipedia. 
support,I would have nominated him if I had know he wasn't a member of the [[Wikipedia:Revert|mop]] and [[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|flamethrower]] [[Wikipedia:Administrator|federation]]. 
support,I thought he was an admin already O_o 
support,per nomination.
support,Well I was going to vote oppose but it seems he reached 2000 edits...! (just in case you didn't know I was kidding about the 2000 mark thing) 
oppose,Boothy443 err yeah whatever (No one should go unopposed) 
support,Sometimes passionate but very reasonable to deal with. 
support,Don't always agree with his POV but seems very reasonable to deal with and unlikely to abuse admin privileges. 
support,not only a talented editor but also a natural born leader. I've seen him organize very interesting initiatives by himself like [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Argentina]]. 
support,[[Soup|Supp]]ort 
support,there can't be enough. and I think he is a good guy 
support,I've come across him on the [[Falkland Islands]] page and his edits relating to that subject have impressed me. He seems reasonable considerate and (from what I've seen so far) a really nice guy. 
support,Is the kind of person that wouldn't abuse of the Admin status. 
support,friendly user with good approach to editing. 
support,Friendly nononsense guy. Number of edits is just a matter of time. 
support,Displays great leadership in the Argentine group. 
support,Friendly user!!! 
support,very polite and at the same time objective has kept his cool even when others haven't knowledgeable in the areas of his interest etc. etc. etc. 
support,I never ran into the guy however I am very impressed with his style after checking him out. 
support,I've been impressed w/his edits and reasonable interactions w/users on contentious pages. 
oppose,4 months and 1374 edits is not enough. I am sure that eventually he will make a good admin
oppose,per Rogerd. 
oppose,nothing personal but four months is just a little less than I feel is needed to really evaluate. 
support,A careful and productive editor as well as a good member of the community. 
support,I've seen his edits on some topics I keep an eye on and they've always seemed good to me. 
support,This should be no big deal. 
support,I was impressed recently with his balanced and temperate response to some very unpleasant personal insults.> in response to what seemed to me to be impeccable editing. 
support,Absolutely. 
support,My experience with Sessel edits is quite good. I don't think the issue (see comments bellow) over lists of dictarors and fathers of nations is much of importance in voting here I am glad Sesel took care and the problem is general. 
support,in line with my position that admin status should be easy to obtain and rather quickly withdrawn with zero tolerance of any abuse for personal reasons rather than use in the service of the community. Based on his editing tastes Sesel appears to likely to increase admin coverage in some of the more obscure nether regions of wikipedia.
support,I've seen quite a lot of this user around the place. As his political opposite I kept an eye on him for quite a while to watch for POV but he passed that test with flying colours. He does a very good job of keeping his opinions out of his edits and I am prepared to trust him fully with the keys. By the way I would have nominated him myself had I realized he wasn't already an admin. 
support,Great editing record. And I like the [[Wikipedia:Bad_Jokes_and_Other_Deleted_Nonsense_Strike_Back#List_of_Disneyworlds_in_Andorra|List of Disneyworlds in Andorra]]. 
oppose,Does not meet my 
oppose,I have very negative experiences of Sesel. I see him as someone who prefers to engage in edit wars rather than discussion on the talk page which is very inappropriate for an admin. I haven't found the few edits I've seen have given me faith either in his ability as an encyclopedia writer or as someone into NPOV. He put an external link is to give a bad link which the reader then has to find the 2 connecting links ploughing through SOAB watch in order to eventually find the tiniest of paragraphs stuck at the bottom of a page. It felt like he was advertising SOAB watch to me; perhaps he is different when not dealing with [[El Salvador|El Salvadorean]] politicians? 
oppose,Oppose. He didn't respond to the matter Squeakbox raised at Roberto D'Aubuisson and although it may be a minor issue responsiveness and accepting responsibility for one's actions are key attributes in an admin. 
support,user has a crazy large edit count and seems to be doing everything in their power to make wiki better... 
support,I'd trust 's nod even if I didn't happen to know that has all the ingredients of a positive admin force for Wikipedia. 
support,Stephen's modesty is really something to admire. 
support,deserves the recognition 
support,giving admin powers to someone who will barely use them isn't a problem; we should be concerned only if they'll use them inproperly. 15000 solid edits tell me that he won't.
support,he has made a very solid contribution to Wiki and it appears that admin powers will only assist him to continue to make a contribution. 
support,The answers to the first question are reasonable and show honesty and sincerity. Has a huge track record of solid contributions and whenever he breaks away from adding content to this Encyclopedia and performs some admin duties we'll be the better for it. 
support,We're much better off having a careful and honest admin than someone who feels they have something to prove. 
support,So what if this nominee isn't planning on hanging around [[WP:AfD]]. 
support,Strong we need as many trusted experienced users to be admins as possible even if they don't use it much. If in his normal article editing he sees something that needs an admin he will already be there with the power 
support,with milk Dear god we should be ashamed of ourselves not having given this guy adminship before! Who cares if he spends hours vandalhunting if he blocks one vandal a month that's one user left the rest of you guys need to deal with. 
support,On one hand why give him admin privileges if he won't use them? On the other hand why not? 
support,It's better to have a person that we trust being an admin just in case. We don't "need" vandal fighting admins (though it is a great help) but that's not all adminship is about. The spirit of adminship (IMO) is that the community trusts you enough to give you extra power to help deal with situations that might require them. Hell the more admins we can trust the better. 
support,I do symphatize with his position on the use of admin powers. 
support,Better to underuse admin powers than to abuse them. 
support,User has over 15000 edits and the only complaints as I far as I can see are that he feels like he can make most of his contributions to Wikipedia without additional powers which I feel that most users should be able to do. If the User finds his admin powers useful when dealing with vandalism on some of the many articles on which he works then it is in the best interest of Wikipedia to give him the extra powers even if he is not required to use them often.
support,Can definitely be trusted with admintools. 
support,It is amazing to see that we have a number of volunteer administrators who essentially work "full time" on this project. Sometimes it is nice to have more administrators who can dedicate that sort of time and energy to the project. However we have to remember that we are primarily promoting users who are trustworthy who can be ambassadors for the community and who can help out whenever they can at their leisure. 17000 edits is a tremendous amount of dedication to the project. This user is a thoroughly competent and trustworthy Wikipedian and there is no reason to suspect that any of the administrative functions if given would be misused. This is a user who is exceptionally observant and would clean up after the dangling ends we may occasionally miss or forget sometimes. For example it could be things like adding missing protection tags to pages deleting unsourced pictures fixing page histories and processing requested moves. 
support,Seems like a very reasonable candidate I'm not concerned about not using admin powers often. 
support,Obviously. If he only seldomly blocks and protects then so what? As already said better underused than abused. He is trustworthy period.
support,though please do keep in mind what Mendel said in his vote. While normally I'm not likely to support users with few WP: namespace edits his edit count is impressive and being active here for 17 months and >17000 edits shows tremendous dedication to this project. 
support,good lord. Not doing a ton with the tools doesn't mean that they don't deserve them. 
support,If six oppose voters haven't yet managed to come up with a good reason for opposing it's safe to say there isn't one. 
support,Per IRC cabal 
support,[[WP:ESP|e]]
support,although I don't know 'em. 
support,No convincing reason was given to oppose. Admins have access to some tools they are not obligated to use them. Let's see if there are any good reasons to support... plenty of good work has demonstrated trustworthiness and has a great amount of experience. 
support,thought he already was one and I want to cancel out one of the oppose votes. 
support,per Chris Parham Sjakkalle and Happy's comments. I am particularly mystified by suggestions that his recent break should in any way be counted against him—the guy has made 17000 nonharmful edits and in my book he's perfectly entitled to take a break for personal reasons momentarily. The only possible area of concern is his extremely limited participation in the WP namespace involvement in which often indicates interest and familiarity with the workings of WP and related policy matters which are important for admins. However his positive attributes and obvious good sense convince me that he'll spend the necessary time to learn up these things before employing any new buttons he might receive. 
support,the desire not to use the admin powers once gained doesn't bother me after all adminship is not supposed to be a big deal 
support,I didn't express interest in using admin powers much either in my RfA but ended up using them rather extensively. We need all the help we can get and if the powers are used seldom nothing was lost. 
support,I actually thought Sfoskett was an admin from when I first came here but now that I've seen that he isn't a mod and has made a large number of edits I support him. 
support,Using the admin tools appropriately once in a while is better than not at all right? 
support,He deserves the tools whether he uses them as much as others or not. 
support,Just because someone won't be a terribly active admin doesn't mean they shouldn't have the powers. It's not a zerosum game. Giving more people more tools to make this place better can only make this place better even if those tools aren't used all that often by a particular person. There is no harm in lessactive admins. 
support,using them occasionally is enough. [[user:Celestianpower|Cel]][[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
oppose,per Durin's comments. Plus I dont think that I can support someone who isnt necessarily desirious of sysop powers; we need more active admins. You can decline the nomination until you feel you are ready. 
oppose,sorry I've changed my vote. I guess I didn't read clearly since I just saw "I accept this nomination somewhat reluctantly. I did not seek admin rights and will not use them much but would appreciate them." we don't need admins that will barely use admin powers. Admins are needed to be active and stop trolls vandals etc. 
oppose,based on the bizarre answer to question 1. 
oppose,no offense to the editor but if you're not going to use the powers "much at all" then I don't see a point or a reason to give them to you at all. Good editor to be sure but why should we bother here? It's like telling the coach of a basketball team that you'll play but if the ball is passed to you you might not shoot it. 
oppose,Respectful oppose. Awesome contributor but why force adminship on someone more interested in making the encyclopedia better than defending it from vandals and such? 
support,edit history looks trustworthy enough to support.
support,Looks to be more than capable. 
support,Need more vandal fighters. 
support,Would be a good help. 
support,Good vandal fighter. 
support,Very strong support

support,Sorry about before. Left the computer sitting too long and it logged out. 
support,I first met shortly after seeing [[Spring Heeled Jack]] appear on [[Special:Newpages]]. Since starting that article she has shown a determination to improving Wikipedia and commitment to working with the community. Should make a fine admin.
support,Sopport a contientious editor 
support,no question. 
support,extremely intelligent and beautiful. 
support,Although as usual brings up good points but the response was good and [[Spring Heeled Jack]] is an interesting and informative article.
support,quite frankly I don't think any of the objections indicate that Shauri will not be a good administrator; while I would like to see more time on the project her answers to the questions impressed me. | [[User talk:Flcelloguy|A note? ]]</font color>| 
support,extremely talented writer and editor. I have seen no contentious behaviour that would make me think she would abuse her admin powers. To the contrary I think she will use them well for the betterment of the community. 
support,despite the low count I can see that valuable contributions come from this editor and see no reason why she'd be different as admin. 
support,great editor. Grace Note's arguments are not convincing at all. 
support,Seems to be a fine user most Wikipedians will have periods of time away from the project now and then so that is not a worry. 
support,I think she is doing good things here. 
support,and great work on SpringHeeled Jack. I added some stuff to that awhile back. 
support,I don't see why taking [[Wikipedia:Wikiholiday|wikibreak]]s once in a while means she's untrustworthy. 
support,Looking at her contribs this is a great editor. I fail to see why her "jumping right in" so to speak should be counted against her even if she was doing it because she wanted adminship. As for her short tenure at Wikipedia that would normally dissuade me from supporting but this seems an exceptional case. 
support,supporting an editor who combines aboveaverage editing skills with aboveaverage communityskills: we need more editors and more admins like her. 
support,Yes please. 
support,Of the most enthusiastic kind. I admit I'm biased...but my bias is based on her proven abilities personality and all around good judgements. All essential qualities for an admin. All of which go far beyond simply how long one has been an active Wikipedian or sheer volume of edits or articles started. This is a clear case of quality over quantity and it is my privillage and pleasure to vote AYE! for quality. 
support,I'm unfamiliar with Shauri but I find the supportive arguments here far more convincing than the opposing ones. 
support,Well I've only come across Shauri through seeing her edits which have impressed me; the [[Spring Heeled Jack]] article was fascinating I'm sure many people worked on it but it was her "child". I am also convinced by the argurments used up  by supporters who know her. Her edits seem responsible well thought out and valuable.m/ 
support,The only important criteria for an admin is trustworthiness in following policies and improving the place. The answers below are impressive and in comparison the objections are minor. I'd like to see a longer period of consistent activity too but there is enough to show trustworthiness and that she has the best interests of the project in mind. That should seal it. And a Valenciana? Cool. 
support,I don't see why not. 
support,Great contributor great communicator. 03:28 30 September 2005 (UTC) What's really interesting about her edit history is that this is the first RFA where I can actually determine quite readily the "rate of increase of her enthusiasm" on the Wiki. See [[:Image:Shauri.PNG]] for example although if you wish for an explanation leave a message on my talk page please. 
support,Too many illustrious names above for me to withold a nonillustrious one. In particular HappyCamper's and Taxman's remarks seal it for me.
support,per [[user:HappyCamper|HappyCamper]]. 
support,Breaking my usual practice of not supporting anyone I wasn't previously familiar with for a close nom. It looks as though Shauri has both the familiarity with Wikipedia and the temperament to use adminship well. This should be no big deal. 
support,Wel rounded editor. Some gaps in participation but that is not a big deal. 
support,This user has shown both a commitment to being evenhanded and pleasant on Wikipedia and to the use of communication to resolve disputes on Wikipedia. Despite Oppose comments below I am confident that this user will make an excellent Wikipedia administrator. 
support,without hesitation. A good conscientious balanced editor who shows courtesy on the talk pages. Personally with my Celtic and AngloSaxon background I feel slightly shocked when strangers end their comments with "Hugs" but I suppose that's my problem not hers! ;) 
support,An excellent editor who is very responsive. I support her strongly.
support,&#8212;
support,Ok support. I am not giving any reason as sometimes silence is more musical than music. 
support,I've not seen much of her but FA writers are rare and have to really bend their backs at FAC. 
support,good editor. I found [[Spring Heeled Jack]] to be a very wellwritten article. [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,a good contributor. 
support,a nice lady will be a nice editor. 
support,clearly.
oppose,Looking at her contribs going back a week or two there's a flood of votes on VfD a host of welcoming messages for noobs and loads of edits to her own "workspace". The first looks too much like pumping up her namespace total because some vote against candidates for not editing Wikipedia (something I think is very misguided) and is mostly a bunch of "me too" delete votes from what I can see (which I don't care for because it's my belief that AfD should be a discussion not a pileon) the second well okay maybe she was feeling that kind of feeling and the third well do it in Notepad why not? There are also lots of minor edits that are suggestive of an editor who doesn't use the preview button (something many of us me included fall foul of from time to time). I don't want to be too critical: she seems okay and it's just this side of neutral for me. 
oppose,active for one month then a long hiatus then very active for another month. Will support after a couple more weeks of activity. (for reference the reason I'm opposing is a combination of the gap and activity not the lack of activity by itself) 
oppose,Not a lot of edits for someone that has been on wikipedia for such a long time. 
oppose,per . 
oppose,per Grace Note. 
oppose,as Ryan Norton. I think you are generally good contributor but I expect candidates have a couple months of consistent activity preceeding their nomination. Don't get discouraged though cause Wikipedia does need people like you and if you can keep it up for another month or so I'd probably support you then. 
oppose,too new too low of an edit count. 
oppose,nothing personal just a bit too new to really evaluate. I'm sure in a couple of months she'll be a shooin. 
support,we need more admins doing what he's already demonstrated he wants to do. Would be good admin.
support,A quick check in the contribution log turns up nothing troubling and shows fine use of edit summaries. See no reason to deny tools that will make the user even more effective. 
support,Does good work.
support,Good editor 
support,only first saw him yesterday and I liked what I saw. [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,of course. 
support,looks like a good user. 
support,this user is unlikely to abuse administrator tools. 
support,Delete selfadmitted nn candidate. 
support,giving him the mop would only make his work easier. 
support,because the voices in my head tell me to. 
support,Although the oppose votes below have raised valid points I feel that people often loose touch of the fact that adminship should be "no big deal". I see only reasons to support and none to oppose. 
support,As previously stated in 's RfA not all Wikipedians are going to be editors or contributers to articles. Just as a research center needs both the scientists who do the research and the cleaning crew who makes sure that the place looks nice Wikipedia needs Admins to do article work and Admins to keep things nice and shiny. This user falls under the category of the latter (and there was no offense intended with my remarks. LOL) 
support,Edits and their distribution have "janitor" written all over them. Perfect example of someone who would save time and save everyone else time if given the tools. 
support,Enjoyment derived from janitorial tasks and commitment enough to already do so. Thats a reason to support if I ever saw one.[[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e</u]]>
support,We can always use more janitors especially of such a high quality. 
support,good cleanerupper. 
oppose,I must oppose based on response to question 2. User states not much actual editing I personally feel this is a major point of contention admins are supposed to lead by example... if all we do is cleanup work this encyclopedia doesnt really go anywhere. You should be familiar with all aspects of wikipedia to be a good admin that includes FAC as well as AFD. 
oppose,I'm concerned about Sherool having only 85 posts to article talk pages in six months. Admins need more community involvement than that. I'll support in a couple of months time if he does something about that and as Alkivar said makes more substantive contributions to articles. 
oppose,per SlimVirgin. 
oppose,per Alk and Slim. I note that most of the supportvotes are of the regular "sure why not" kind and do not address these issues. 
support,seems sensible levelheaded and able to resolve disagreements peacefully. 
support,Good editor. 
support,Supppppport.~ 
support,! Surprised he wasn't one.
support,concur with nominator. (Indeed I hadn't realized he wasn't one until the comment about not being able to edit the Main Page.) 
support,good editor 
support,per above; also I trust Michael's judgment. Remember to use edit summaries though. 
support,Very fine contributor. 
support,Good editing knowledge of WP. Thanks for answering the questions in detail. 
support,because there's an aeroplane on the runway. 
support,per nominator. 
support,Strong Great guy has my trust (Yes I've been watching from afar). [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,He could use a rollback button to help with his mass RvV's. 
support,fine candidate. 
support,Admin tools would help vandal fighting see no reasons for concern. 
support,Lots of time on project consistent in his work to understand policy and to follow it. 
support,You mean they're not an admin already? 
support,Oh yeah like a Twix commercial. (That means support.) 
support,Cheers. &middot; 
support,Looks good. . 
support,DAMNIT THAT WAS MY [[first post]]! [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,Yup! Done quite a lot of work around. 
support,Good editor and good temperament.
support,Yes I am supporting him. And I feel guilty – I should have nominated him. Anyway now it is ok. The meaning of his name in [[Sanskrit]] and many languages of [[North India]] means ‘the best’ and during my interaction with him for last several months I really found him to be one amongst the best. All the best to him. And may the Force be with Shreshth now and always! 
support,Looks like a great cantidate for adminship! </big> [[User_Talk:Vilerage|Reply]][[Special:Emailuser/Vilerage|Spam Me!]]</strong>
support,I was thinking about nominating him for adminship acually. Good editor 
support,without any reservations. Has done some wonderful work on a wide range of articles. 
support,Good editor 
support,support 
support,You were the first to vote on my first RFA. Your vote was "Opposetoo inexperienced" That somehow started a plieon. Now Im gonna support you mainly as a thank you for allowing me to step back and gain the experience that I needed to become a Sysop. I know that you will do a good job. "May the force be with you!" 
support,A very good candidate for adminship. 
support,happy to ' 
support,Of course as nominator I support! 
support,After watching him in action tonight during my first big RC push would be too weak. 
support,Active in opposing vandalism and would do well with a mop. 
support,Good at keeping vandals in [[check (board game)|check]]. ! 
support,Obvious support. has impressed in many ways but I think the deciding factor for me was his moderation in the face of personal attacks on VfD. Oh and the fact that he likes chess ;). 
support,definitely. Another use of the tired "I thought he already was one!" though I guess I should have figured out that he's only been closing the keeps on VfD... 
support,Mopworthy. 
support,antivandalism is great and the article writing is a plus too. 
support,A assiduous courteous editor. 
support,I seem to have run into Sjakkale on several occasions I nominated for deletion two articles whose VFD debate is mentioned on his user page and I also put [[Queen's Gambit Accepted]] on the suggestions page for [[WP:DYK|DYK]] (<http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:Did_you_know&diff=12303459&oldid=12296932 diff>). Might disagree with him on some VFD topics but he's a good author and knows Wikipedia principles very much deserves to be an admin. 
support,Not an admin already? 
support,support 
support,Very good at detecting subtle vandalism <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sperm&curid=27638&diff=0&oldid=0> 
support,Although we may need to establish a rota for VfD closers before long so we don't clobber one another. 
support,You deserve to be promoted to adminship because of your dedication to the project. Good luck 
support,=
support,I've seen Sjakkalle doing various RC Patrolling activities and closing VfDs. This person would make a valuable admin. 
support,And the mop goes to... 
support,Easy decision. 
support,Having just seen Sjakkalle chasing up a vandal it seems an excellent time to vote support... 
support,Strong great work on VfD 
support,Edit history indicates responsible adminship likely. 
support,Looks good and Michael's endorsement goes a long way. 
support,has been a warrior on the railrelated pages he has made at least a minor contribution to virtually every one and has more or less single handedly created three feature articles that I know of [[John Bull (locomotive)]] [[Franklin B. Gowen]] and [[Pioneer Zephyr]]. He is the undisputed king of [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Trains]] and has been unfailingly courteous on talk pages 
support,A hardworking editor who has shown he can work with others. 
support,Definitely. A strong editor who should make a good admin. 
support,Slambo's a conscientious hardworking editor who cares about accuracy. 
support,Definitely. 
support,He is very honorable about respecting other people's work and has great organizational skills. An earned step with additional power which I am very confident will only be used to enhance WP. 
support,Excellent participant in writing contests 
support,Our train master. 
support,Offered constructive criticism on one of my train articles. 
support,As I'm a distant relative (by de facto at least) of [[William Hedley]] how could I not support? 
support,Meets my 
support,Yep he deserves it. . 
support,A very good example of a very good Wikipedian. 
support,I like his user and talk pages which show us he is polite and works well with others. 
support,Absolutely support. Eight thousand edits and a number of featured articles in the course of six months is enough for me. He's also a helluva nice guy. 
support,Absolutely. SlimVirgin is an excellent editor in many ways but I'm particularly pleased with her thoughtful attitude and her dedication to verifiability.— 
support,Very thoughtful and conscientious contributor. 
support,Good addition. 
support,She's been active enough that I recognize her even in my own semiactivity. Her contributions show lots of activity on talk pages which is a good thing for an admin. 
support,Oh definitely. Her potential admin abilities even make up for the fact that she likes [[poodle|longlegged hamsters]]. 
support,Absolutely. Remains courteous and reasonable without compromising her position on the quality of the encyclopedia. 
support,How can I say no? She has shown a great ability for working with others and an understanding of policy. 
support,Impossible for me to leave without some loose ends to tie up. Most definitely support! 
support,Without a doubt. 
support,Very good editor.
support,Soitenly. 
support,yep. 
support,You mean she isn't already? 
support,Sure. 
support,Certainly. 
support,Another name I recognize. 
support,Obviously. 
support,Sure. Certainly. Obviously. Any cliche will do. 
support,Oh i thought you already were. Well then it ain't too late. 
support,SlimVirgin is everywhere! Now seriously I've seen SV doing some really topdrawer edits. . 
support,Slim who? Oh there she is! 
support,No my vote's not needed at this point and yes it's a cliché but I thought she was already too.
support,and feel free to add the cliché of shock and surprise of your choice. Still I like these easy votes. 
support,chiming in 
support,All edits I've seen are good. 
support,I can't think of anyone more suited to being an admin; she's not only a dedicated editor but brings a cool head and a conciliatory approach to difficult situations. 
support,Stresstested reliable. 
support,Keep Trivia: the user's name comes from an awesome petrified Javanese princess and not a yucky smelly cigarette. 
support,never seen an edit by this user that wasn't npov and for the good of Wikipedia.This is the kind of person I want to have admin powers! 
support,Will make a great admin. I am especially impressed with her ability to handle conflict situations.
support,A nobrainer. This vote is I mean. Of course. . 
support,Total support. Companions of Arctic Snow Poodles are alright with me. 
support,You know you're doing something right when the database is locked for part of the day and you still get 41 support votes the first day alone. This is an easy call 
support,Everyone's said everything already. 
support,I have always found SlimVirgin to be a fair and generous editor given to productive discussion rather than unnecessary conflict. These qualities become a good administrator and SlimVirgin will surely serve with excellence.
support,I agree with the statements above. 
support,What do you mean I never check RfA anymore? See! I do too check it. 
support,Doesn't look like she needs my support. You'll be a great admin! I'm just worried you'll ban me for forgetting to cite a source! 
support,Excellent editor good conflict resolver stronge supporter of Wikipedia policy very clearheaded comments on Talk: pages. 
support,Definitely for patience and panache. 
support,←
support,Absolutely. Very concientious editor. 
support,Sure. 
support,Hell yeah! 
support,Agree with all the above. 
support,strongly. I'm glad SV finally accepted the nomination. 
support,This vote is not needed but still... 
support,Absolutely. Very clueful about Wikipedia's social structure in general. In particular she handled the harrowing battle with the LaRouche POVpusher brilliantly and brought the ArbCom a very usable case 
support,emphatically. Slim is a dedicated and officious editor with a mind towards the maintenance of community standards and the blunting of attempts to corrupt the project's NPOV. I believe Slim will be an unqualified success as an admin. 
support,Oh surely. 
support,A very good user. Amply qualified to be an admin. Good luck. 
support,Strongly support. 
support,strongly. A gem of an editor brandisher of the NPOV sword with a gentle touch. We need more like her around. 
support,Strong Excellent editor and creative problem solver with wiki troublespots. 
support,Problem solver is right. 
support,Absolutely. 
support,Yes yes yes. 
support,Top quality Wikipedian. 
support,Consensus and accuracy minded 
support,SV is beyond patient and works hard for consensus.
support,Meets my 
support,Yup.
oppose,Seems to have too aggressive and determined an attitude against other POVs which is troublesome when someone on the other side has been banned—does that mean people who disagree with her end up going to the ArbCom? Not a good sign. The best articles are the products of collaboration with people who represent a variety of views. 
support,Good 'janitor'. 
support,My direct experience is positive. I didn't find anything in history to reject. Thanks for dealing with vandals. 
support,Almost anyone who is a janitor gets my vote. 
support,Good janitor interacts well extra points for the selfnom.
support,Mais certainement. 
support,Looks good.
support,Seen positive good work. 
support,Seen this user on cricketrelated articles 
support,But of course. 
support,A good chap he is obviously passionate about what he does
support,He dealt with in an exemplary manner and is also a good janitor how can I not support? 
support,SUPPORT. I'm new here and Smoddy helped me find my feet; I've also had a little [[User_talk:JMBell|chat]] with him and I have concluded that he is a very responsible Wikipedian. Admin material. Good record. Etc etc. I've checked his history and dealings with the user . Pretty laudable for a 16yr.old. A very good friend to have and a very reliable ally. Very passionate about Wpdia. Responsible chap etc. etc. 
support,Reasonable person and good janitor. 
support,I thought he was an Admin 
support,I just now read his Featured Article nice work I can say as I have been a student of international law 'one generation' before. And Smoody is only 16 that is today's news for me. All the best to Smoddy: me the oldest of the lot voting for the youngest amongst most of us.
support,someone who goes through the "What links here" of a disambig page and corrects them all is a dedicated janitor. 
support,Strict and stern but controlled and fair too (in his dispute with ). Just like an admin should be. 
support,Looking good! 
support,I didn't vote here yet? Wow. Strongly support. 
support,Of course. 
support,Does not meet (though of course if [[Mark Butcher]] and [[Alan Knott]] were truly comprehensive they'd be up to FA status too!

support,endless stub sorting. 
support,good edits and stubsorting. 
support,of course. An excellent mentor. Worthy in our opinion to be a good Admin. 
support,great user would benefit from admin powers. 
support,The gotoguy when it comes to stubsorting. 
support,Strong contributions in all aspects of Wikidom. 
support,The interaction with is much more telling than the interaction with . 
oppose,I felt he was rude when I interacted w him see [[Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Music_genres#heavy_metal]]. 
oppose,on account of the above two exchanges. If Sn0wflake can't model [[WP:COOL]] and [[WP:civ]] on RfA I don't have much reason to expect him to do so when using the admin tools. An excellent Wikipedian by all other accounts; I especially appreciated Sn0wflake's revision of [[Sonata Arctica]]. 
oppose,I dislike the above exchanges too. The least I expect from an admin is to be civil. 
support,Strong as nominator 
support,Strong as seconder 
support,Strong also. His edits on Australian and Western Australian history are top notch and he's always helpful and friendly to other editors. A worthy recipient who will addvalue to Wikipedia with the admin tools. 
support,Has made a strong contribution especially in the Australian related articles. 
support,One of the best editors I've ever seen with a temperament to match even in the face of some serious wikistalking from disgruntled anons. 
support,Funny that he hasn't been nominated yet. I guess everyone assumed he already was one (ZING! Weren't expecting the template to show up just yet eh?). he's a top bloke a conscientious editor and of course an Aussie. 
support,Contributions look very solid. . [[Image:Flag_of_Austria.png|15px]] 
support,after hearing from abt a query I had. 
support,Good contributor. 
support,Drew is a great contributor. 
support,good editor will be a good admin

support,excellent contributor! </big> [[User_Talk:Vilerage|Reply]][[Special:Emailuser/Vilerage|Spam Me!]]</strong>
support,once you get over the fact that his username sounds particularly unappetising he is an excellent editor who would make a very good admin. 
support,another valuable Australian editor especially for WA and plants. 
support,He may have managed to escape the RfA for long but he should not be “allowed” to escape now! 
support,although... strewth I fear the Aussies are taking over! 
support,Regularly appears in my watchlist with good edits. 
support,Sounds good. 
support,per everyone else. 
support,SnottyG's impressive diligence eye for fine detail and consultative nature make for a commendable admin.

support,Yeah. Will be good. [[Image:Flag_of_Europe_and_Austria.svg|20px]] 
support,amazingly meticulous and dedicated. Will make a great admin! 
support,of course.
support,A quick look at last 300 edits looks good. Answers to questions are good. Therefore support is good. 
support,MEGA ULTRA Leithp and 10 others beat me to it SUPPORT In addition to being a meticulous and dedicated contributor and vandal fighter he's also a helluva cool dude. It is a honor to call him my friend and a pleasure to wholeheartedly support his elevation to adminship for which he has clearly demonstrated his worthiness.
support,No reason not to support a fellow editor that is committed to this project. 
support,Devoted and reliable editor. Also the comparison between your internet connection and "a onelegged turtle on sleeping pills" (question 1) was the best I've heard in a while. 
support,Looks like a fine contributor.

support,Would benefit from the admin rollback button et al. 
support,Definitely. 
support,Always a good sign for me when I can totally respect the contributions and attitude of an editor whose world view is diametrically the oposite of mine. 
support,He's got the qualities of a good wikipedian. Opposes vandalism and tries to make this a better place. 
support,Edits raise no concerns regarding abuse of admin powers. 
support,Seems like a trustworthy and dedicated editor. 
support,great work on featured lists
support,Wikipedia needs admins like him.
support,Welcome aboard! 
support,Familiar name. Good and trustworthy contributor. Admin. 
support,Great work on the Signpost and elsewhere. 
support,Splash has shown a great deal of good work during his three months here with well rounded contributions and levelheaded participation in VFD debates. 
support,Wouldn't have nominated if I didn't support. 
support,Remember you from the crazy AfD debate... I honestly thought he was already one so I'll have to vote support. Just remember to try to detach yourself when you use the new tools 
support,not only did I think he already was one I was absolutely certain of it. Very very very good contributor. 
support,ITHAWO 
support,competent and levelheaded user. 
support,no worries with Splash 
support,Strong Don't worry about the relative newness: Splash is a prolific dedicated and intelligent contributor with a strong sense of policy. Great work all around but on VfD specifically. 
support,Strong Ditto to what ulayiti said. I see you at VfDs so much I figured you were an admin just waiting to close them. [[User Talk:Acetic Acid|Acetic]]
support,Strong Great contributor to many areas of Wikipedia. 
support,AfD work speaks for itself.
support,I too was surprised to discover that he wasn't already an admin. 
support,Very solid. 
support,Nominate. It's been eight hours and I'm #18. Hmph. 
support,Splash has been doing awesome work at VfD (or shall I say AfD now) 
support,Contribs look great. Very hard worker. 8000+ edit adminship seems long over due! Also if says support that is good enough for me. 
support,long overdue. 
support,Strong thats over 8000 edits in three months! Rolled back his edits; a very notable candidate. I also like the 'essay type' answers to the questions You would make a very good admin. Good luck! </sup/><p style="fontfamily: Bradley Hand ITC Comic Sans MS;">
support,Yes I too. 
support,I've seen you around. 
support,although I'm not familliar with this user his responses to the questions were excellent. He's obviously given a lot of thought to the admin position and I believe he will make an excellent one. 
support,Strong ! Heck yes! A very helpful and useful user. Good luck with your admin duties 
support,I like to see a little longer with the project but excellent record of contributions shows Splash is trustworthy which is the most important thing. 
support,Trustworthy as well as effective at RC patrol. 
support,good allaround editor 
support,as I said I would once you had a few months experience. 
support,Simple . 
support,absolutely. Just look at the way Splash answers the "Questions for the candidate" section so throughly and professionally. He does a lot of excellent judgement on VfD and other Wikipedia processes and is quickly one of Wikipedia's "backbone" members. It really is time for him to get admin status. Great guy and great work on Wikipedia. 
support,What? Isn't he already an admin???? Then he surely deserves to get the broom and the flamethrower. No objections from here. 
support,Fully unconditionaly and completely! I'm only sorry I wasn't first on this list. 
support,Absolutely without hesitation; can certainly be trusted with the mop and bucket. 
support,Strong He will make a great admin in fact I thought he was one already! 
support,as per all above. 
support,Wow really thought Splash was an admin. [[User_talk:bmicomp|(talk]] 
support,WT...? Splash is not an admin? Well then it's about time he was.
support,Bing! yes folks! That's the sound of yet another vote being added! 
support,Of Course 
support,thought he already was an admin. 
support,Strong I absolutely hate using ye olde RFA cliche but again I'm forced to: thought he was one already. 
support,He's sober thoughtful and thorough. 
support,Appears to be a strong deletionist but I'm confident that he won't abuse sysop powers. 
support,Extremely active in janitorial tasks. 
support,I've seen this guy in action during RC Patrols; he knows what he's doing! 
support,You are the only person to vote oppose on my RfA who I would vote for. You've caught my mistakes and helped me fix them before the community found em many times ;) You've been helpful to me and I hope I have been to you but now you get your own SysOp [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,even though it's not needed. 
support,I notice Splash regularly doing RC and A/VfD. He is clear and helpful. 
support,Contributes a lot 
support,I thought he was an admin already. 
support,Meets . 
support,In my brief return I have been impressed by Splash's work. I don't understand how it was Splash's fault that 13 other people opposed an RfA. 
support,Of course Splash gets nominated while I'm out of town. Pity; I had a truely moving bit of prose in the works for my support vote now it would just be a waste of pixels as this deserving nominee appears to have nearunanimous support. Splash will be a great admin. 
support,I tried to nominate him before. : ( <p style="fontfamily: Comic sans Comic Sans MS monospace;">
support,I've been waiting to support Splash I'm glad to see this nomination. 
support,A reliable editor. 
support,I don't know him all that well but he had a minor disagreement with me on a VFD i closed today and I really like the way he handled it. Obviously not an idiot 
support,Showed extreme good sense in the Lame 'upper middle income' edit war in [[Malaysia]]. Blaming him for Rls departure is harsh btw. 
support,Dedicated contributor. 
support,We need more like Splash. 
support,Mmm hmm. 
oppose,ironically because of dodgy voting in RFA: started a trend the outcome of which was detrimental to the wiki. 
support,Naturally I'm the nominator! 
support,I've seen Andrew around a lot; seems like a fine contributor. Have a mop! (Could use more edit summaries though.) 
support,! You're freaking kidding me Andrew's not an admin? Must fix that immediately! 
support,Levelheaded and concerned about WP. &middot; 
support,because I thought he already was. Good contributor and solid reasonable person. 
support,Articulate and wise. 
support,All major concerns addressed. (More edit summaries please.) 
support,Addressed for me too. 
support,Plenty of good of good work and fit for adminship. Incidentally about deletionism (which in my opinion is not a thing which makes anybody unfit for adminship) there is at least [[Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/The Fans|one case]] where Starblind cast the single dissenting nondelete vote. 
support,I've always found him to be reasonalble I also see no evidence to suggest that there would be a conflict of interest for any admin that votes on vfd and closes vfd. 
support,had the same concerns as Unfocused but his research and Starblind's explanation/diffs have addressed them adequately. Thanks for your work on VfD! 
support,civil user who makes high quality edits. 
support,While I can't say I agree with the deletionism that's not the issue here Starblind can simply be trusted with the keys to the janitor's closet. 
support,He's answered my concerns about VfD and low numbers of article edits. 
support,Comments below. 
support,per comments on his low edit count below. Andrew's involved in many aspects of Wikipedia combined with his deceptively low edit count of the main articlespace. 
support,looks like valuable admin. | [[User talk:Flcelloguy|A note? ]]</font color>| 
support,I see nothing wrong with a user who has a large focus on VfD debates. A mop in his hands would be a helpful force. 
support,Good grasp of policy interest in and reasonable comments on VfDs just the kind of editor who will make good use of admin abilities. 
support,Full frontal SUPPORT Cause Starblind he da man... that's right I said it 
support,I encounter Starblind often in VfD and while I don't agree with him a fair amount he obviously puts thought and effort into his votes. I was hesitant to support with only 222 article edits but it appears most of those edits are "major" edits and I consider 222 such edits (including quite a few new articles) much better than 1500 more useless edits like sorting stubs bypassing redirects or overcategorizing articles. I think he understands Wikipedia well enough to be an admin. 
support,Enthusiastically support! One of the hardest working cleaneruppers here. 
support,Very active in VfD et al. As mentioned by others he frequently seems to use an offline editor and only saves his final drafts here on WP. 
support,very good editor 
support,I have bumped into the Starblind quite a few times while on VfD; no negative experiences. Will make a good admin. 
support,One of the users I was most impressed by when I first arrived at Wikipedia. 
support,Imho Starblind is in the top echelon of WP users. 
support,This seems to be a good example against editcounting. Starblind has made more of a contribution to article space textwise and qualitywise than someone who simply adds a stub tag to 1500 articles. (One of his edit summaries is "New article. 10 paragraphs.") I see nothing to suggest he wouldn't be a fine admin; I'd expect him not to close VfDs he voted in which despite his activity there still leaves plenty. 
support,That's hot. 
support,He has some very solid edits to article space appears to have a good grasp of policy and is willing to contribute to VFD cleanup. Go for it. 
support,Understands WP policies upholds the integrity of the encyclopedia. 
support,Hard worker on VFD valuable contributions. Expect he will do a good job as administrator helping to deal with some of the workload there (more hands are sorely needed). 
support,yes indeed. Not everyone's willing to labor in the slum of VfD and I respect those who do. 
support,I have no doubt that Starblind will be a good admin. 
support,without hesitation. 
oppose,Oppose. Looked at user contributions and it seemed like threefourths of them were to VFD pages. Please come back when you have worked on more articles. 
oppose,OpposeI think I'm only familiar from VfD but I remember a lot of strong deletionism and also some hostility towards me. 
oppose,Oppose. Too few edits in article space. 
oppose,Oppose. Insufficient edits to article space excessive concern with Votes for Deletion and a too strict interpretation of policy which fails to give appropriate flexibility in individual circumstances. 
oppose,Oppose. Too few edits in article space and too inflexible. 
oppose,It's all been said. 
oppose,Oppose. He has only been here for just over six months. Potential admins must have contributed to Wikipedia for at least nine months. 
oppose,Reverse proportion of edits between VfD and articles. I'd be keener on this guy becoming an admin if he promised not to close VfDs. He's way too interested in deletion all in all.
oppose,I oppose anyone who spends that much time on VfD even if he is a good and reasonable editor in general. The result would be an administrator with a very distorted view of Wikipedia because he sees only the worst of it the majority of the time. It'd be like electing a hobo who lives in the sewers as mayor of a city. 
oppose,Starblind seems to be a very active contributor but I'm wary of the practice of spending the majority of one's efforts on deleting content rather than providing it. It's much easier to remove than it is to add and I think an admin should make a positive contribution. In short: insufficient work on article namespace; please try again later. 
support,I support him. He sounds good enough. 
support,Sounds good to me. 
support,I support it !!!. 
support,good user 
support,Good nomination. 
support,Oh yes. 
support,Makes WP more international/multicultural. 
support,I have seen this name quite a bit when reading Indian related articles. 
support,Yes ... Nomination has my I find Sundar has been extending support to wiki concept 
support,of course. But he should be required to help searching more Admins for the Tamil Wikipedia even if he didn't want't to become one himself for technical reasons I understand. 
support,Very Good Candidate. 
support,Sundar appears to be a cautious kind of editor who avoids conflicts strives for factual accuracy and works well with other users. A random sampling of his contributions reveals a user of the kind that we could do with more of. 
support,unlikely to abuse administrator tools. 
support,Good user 
support,I'm biased (we've known each other ten years) but what the hell. I introduced him to wiki and now he's even more active than I am. 
support,I've interacted with this user often at the funhouse that is Recent Deaths and have found him levelheaded and of sound judgment. Certainly mopworthy. 
support,good editor 
support,Crazy username (I am still trying to make sense out of it ) loves to tell people when they voted twice on their RfA's. I say support [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|ε]]
support,everything looks fine to me.
support,Looks U.S.A AOK to me :D 
support,Sure. [[Image:Flag_of_Europe_and_Austria.svg|20px]] 
support,&#8766; Wikipedia will benefit from giving Syrthiss the mop and bucket. → 
support,Solid record. 
support,I see him around doing good things. A lot of vandal reversion and tagging welcoming and editting. Worn out as it may sound I assumed he was an administrator. 
support,hope to see you doing good work but I am confident that you will.
support,nominator. 
support,Damn you Knowledge Seeker! I was going to do this tomorrow. Ah well. As big a support as is allowed. 
support,In the past month since he withdrew his nomination he has helped get [[Windows 2000]] and [[Architecture of Windows 2000]] to featured article status. 
support,He's an excellent editor and was a great admin too always willing to look at both sides of any situation and amenable to persuasion without getting into entrenched positions. He could have continued with his last nomination but he did the honorable thing and fell on his sword another plus point. 
support,I agree with Slim.
support,I was sure he already was one... 
support,I think we can allow someone to make a mistake. He was a great admin in the past and will be one again in the future. 
support,support again 
support,support what again? Sometimes I wonder if we don't go overboard on this procedure stuff. We all know ta bu shi da yu isn't going turn into tbsdyzilla overnight and "Destroy The Wiki!" Sheesh! 
support,Welcome back Ta bu shi da yu. 
support,of course and I believe your nomination a month ago would have passed in spite of your mistake. 
support,of course. 
support,ed last time support this time too. 
support,(well pending acceptance of course). 
support,Of course. TBSDY is one of the most humble people here and a prolific contributor. 
support,Never! Never! He vandalised an article once! 
support,Duh. | [[User_talk:Linuxbeak|Talk]] | 
support,once again. 
support,strongly support 
support,Of course. 
support,Give back to him the place that's always been his. 
support,For great wikijustice. 
support,Nothing bad's happened in the past month to change my stance from the previous RFA. 
support,so long as he doesn't take this RfA as permission to go on another vandalism spree ;) 
support,It took guts to withdraw from the last RfA. 
support,Forshizzle. All opposers are dumdums. 
support,I assumed he was already too. (Back when I didn't know how to make redirects he maybe coincidentally but it did help a lot made one that unorphaned a page I'd created. Good first impression and not made worse...) 
support,His statement above shows that he is again ready for adminship. 
support,All my support for this fine contributor. 
support,but of course for the umpteenth time : ) 
support,TBSDY shouldn't have mucked around with the [[dalek]] article just as nobody should muck around with any article and yes daleks deserve a serious article but hang on this wasn't [[Curtis LeMay]] let alone [[Adolf Hitler]]: daleks are funny and TBSDY's version of the page made me smile. (If I'd seen it when it was "live" I'd have rushed to revert it to an earlier informative version and with a harrumphing message to the perp but with a twinge of regret.) Daleks aside TBSDY is a hardworking guy with excellent judgement. I don't quite follow what he's saying above about Christianity but anyway his point is that he's going to avoid problems there too. So what except for one ahem error of judgement is not to like? 
support,I accept his explanation for the [[Dalek]] incident as a lapse in judgment. 
support,encore. 
support,What again??!? And we're to take processes seriously?!? [[Dalek|Exterminate all humour]]! (Or is that humor?). Wholeheartedly support of course. 
support,Absolutely. 
support,the Dalek thing? give me a break that was just funny and hardly even qualifies as vandalism. Plus he was sincere enough to ask for deadmining during his wikibreak not something that is done very often. What are you attempting here TBSDY going down in history as the person elected admin most frequently? 
support,The guy even takes responsibility for past mistakes rather than taking the interpersonal warfare route a rare trait amongst Wikipedians. 
support,but I think the community's patience would be tested if there is another RfA. 
support,He sure straightened me out in a hurry with one swift samuraiswordstroke. I just assumed he was an admin already. 
support,He wasn't one already? 
support,Whatever he did I'm sure [[:Image:Crazy guy.jpg|this]] explains it. 
support,Storm in a teacup should be more like him. 
support,objective and fair my kind of admin. 
support,I oppose strongly and support mildly. Or is it the other way around (?) you decide! *[[audience wave|wave]]* 
support,In the immortal words of [[Stacey Stillman]] "You changed your vote!" 
support,YES!!! Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes. Did I happen to say yes? Tabu is one of the clearest kindest and most insightful voices on this crazy site. One little joke...oh heaven forfend!...and you'd have thought it was the end of the world. Real trolls don't get excoriated like he did. I knew there was a good reason that I listened to the little voice egging me on to return as an active editor. When the keys to the closet are returned to Tabu I owe that voice a drink. Bottoms up!! 
support,Again: WWTBSDYD? 
support,Please stay this time. Your calm is legendary and has brought the project much good. 
support,TBSDY was a fine admin before and I find no reason to think that he should not have his adminship back. 
support,IN SOVIET RUSSIA ADMINSHIP SUPPORTS YOU! Vodka! Vodka today? 
support,Strongly! 
support,support and support. 
support,I'm not sure even more votes are needed but I'll add mine anyway. 
support,Tabs A little late on this one. 
support,[[User Talk:Texture|τ]]
support,strongly. I can't understand what all the fuss is about. I've made errors of judgement as have the great majority of admins and to expect TBSDY3 to be an exception is totally unreasonable. 
support,dammit! 
support,He's a nice guy and I don't think lightning falls twice in the same spot. 
support,Again. 
support,Welcome back! | [[User talk:Flcelloguy|A note? ]]</font color>| 
support,TBSDY of course. Welcome back. Heidi & Joe will be watching you as usual. You have helped us round out our opinion about this project in the past and as an Admin you will continue to teach by your example. 
support,Do the oppose people realize he has over 17000 edits and only one or two lapses that were not even malicious? If he hadn't withdrawn his adminship voluntarily he would be an admin by default. And what he did would not have gotten him desysoped. With the recent departure of over a minor infraction I fear we're eating our own young here. Sheesh. 
support,TBSDY. 
support,support See if he can get the 105 votes needed to make a new record! 
support,Yes for the third time now . 
support,Regardless what has happened recently if he hadn't asked to be desysopped he'd still be one. 
support,Too easy. 
support,擁戴. 魚不太大. 
support,Strong 
support,This is good time to come back. First edit in a while for me a pleasue to give it to tabu. However it seems that tabu has been wasting a lot of our time with the whole first 2 wp:rfa's then the big "goodbye" affair the whole "welcome back" saga et al. But this man is the popularest dude on here. So Go on sir edit with your steely knife 
support,again. 
support,Very strong support 
support,I believe that few admins could get redadmined after having served for some time. You get involved in many things and inevtiably you make some bad choices. TBSDY's recent FA is enough for me to vote yes. 
support,While the edits in question were thoughtless and show some questionable judgement on the whole they pale in comparison to the good edits tabu has made. And it is clear a lesson has been learned. Welcome back. 
support,Bah! I don't get to be number 100. Nuts to you Taxman! On a more serious note TBSDY is an excellent Wikipedian; I'll take someone who can admit a mistake any day over someone who hasn't made any yet. 
support,! 
support,Full strong support. 
support,100% support. A firstrate editor who needs to have a mop and bucket. 
support,Hey i guess he pips the other dude at the post then. A "privilige" to be no. 105 at least as far as Wonderfoom is concerned 02:28 26 Jun 2005 (UTC) ( I'm pretty sure that this voter is after a few glasses of whatever. ;) 
support,Go do your thing! 
support,Just what a Wikipedian should be! 
support,Happy to support a great user and please note that with this very vote of mine Ta bu Shi Da Yu now equals the previous RFA record of 109 support votes (and is obviously going to break it)! I was hoping I'd get to do this. 
support,please note with this vote TBSDY now has the record for RfA support votes. 
support,Not that he needs it but I couldn't pass up the opportunity to give him my support. 
oppose,Strongly oppose. Ta bu shi da yu is an example of the worst of administrators. He has arrogated power to himself that no one was ever supposed to have. He deliberately and disingenuously ignores written policies that are intended to limit administrator power to specific tasks at community instruction. Ta bu shi da yu writes his own instructions using editorial discretion that should be used only for editorial work. He will get the power again of course; but he will not deserve it and he will abuse it. 
oppose,I'm still concerned about his behavior during our past dispute; I wouldn't worry about it ordinarily except that recently he explicitly stated that he still believed himself to be in the right about it. Since the matter specifically pertained to an important admin power (blocking) I think that leans me toward oppose. 
oppose,I changed my vote last time believing I had been wrong about him. Apparently I wasn't. 
oppose,moderately 09:04 Jun 21 2005 (UTC) I found Ta bu a bit anal. Too into form rather than substance e.g. he is a big critic of bullets and makes snap criticisms the clumsy language in articles ignoring the history that shows the language to be delicate compromises agreed to by the community. He thus unwittingly it seems is like a bull in a china shop. Here is a link to some of that past experience.<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Peer_review/February_2005#Intelligent_design>
oppose,I find the behaviour outlined in the RFC mentioned above too disturbing to be able to trust Ta bu bi shi yu with restored adminship. I have also found this edit <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Zoroastrianism&diff=15047128&oldid=15007004> which indicates he/she is too quick to judge especially considering the response to his actions here <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AZoroastrianism&diff=14952798&oldid=14913694> and here <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AZoroastrianism&diff=15047249&oldid=15015156>. I am also quite disturbed by the manner in which a sudden influx of editors supporting his/her point of view appeared see the history here <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Zoroastrianism&action=history> as if a bullying tactic was being attempted. I feel that admin powers would make this attitude worse and more menacing. 
oppose,with a somewhat heavy heart. Not convinced his recent contributions match his previous good record. It's unlikely this nomination will fail but if it does I'm willing to reconsider in a month or so because I like Ta bu but my respect for him has diminished a little bit. 
oppose,I thought ta bu shi da yu was already an admin and when I thought this I didn't like that notion. So no oppose adminship. 
oppose,I'm sorry to oppose but it was only very recently that the last RfA was withdrawn and I'm still worried about the whole vandalism thing. It seems to me it was a major error of judgement very harmful to the project and while you can assure us you won't vandalise an article on the main page again you can't really assure us that your judgment won't lapse again. 
oppose,After reading the comments both support and opposition as well as neutral I feel I have to weigh in on the opposition. I'm certain that is a nice person but nice is not in my opinion reason enough to be an admin. I apologize for my opposition but I believe an adminship requires more calmness and evenhandedness than the candidate has demonstrated in recent months. The candidate seems to also take any opposition far too personal seeming overwhelmingly too eager to become an admin.It's just not that important! That being said on Ta's behalf let me qualify that by saying I would oppose any nominations for adminship for myself given my current inability to think out my responses on heated debates until I could manage a level head over an extended period of time. 
oppose,I believe in forgiveness but the transgression is a little to recent for my taste. Trust once lost is difficult and takes time to regain. 
support,as nominator 
support,Great work on [[WP:TS]]. 
support,Very strong support pending Talrias' aceptance of this nomination 
support,One should not look upon his dispute on the [[phpBB]] page as a sign of a bad admin. Talrias was right in his indication that the number of links needed to be cut down. His edits (after I reviewed them in a calmer state) made sense. He has shown to me that he has a clear head when it comes to improving articles and that he is more than ready to discuss things. Thus I think he should be considered for adminship 
support,Has quite strong views on various Wiki issues but is a good user. 
support,very trustworthy and a good writer of pages. So what if he's proposed changed to the adminship system? Doesn't mean he's ignorant of existing procedures. 
support,this user who seems to take an interest in improving wikipedia and can propose new ideas without trying to push them on everyone without consensus. Interactions with other editors look to be productive and helpful. 
support,good hard working chap. 
support,for lot of useful work. Reform of Wikipedia mechanisms is different and orthogonal to RfA. 
support,Neutral. Everyking has a point. If Talrias believes that a user should have a mentor before being adminified then he should find himself one. But given Talrias's sensible response below I'll move to support anyway. 
support,[[That's hot]]. 
support,STRONG ! Great user I see no reason why he could not be trusted with sysophood. 
support,While I disagree with this editor on some issues none of those disagreements have been anything other than cordial. No reason to believe that he would miswield the mop. . 
support,I agree with Mindspillage and also note that I'm impressed at his regret expressed below for so small a fault as briefly engaging in a titfortat edit war. 
support,I see no reason that he could not be trusted with Admin rights. 
support,Seems responsible dedicated (UK COTW) comments his edits well and makes solid contributions to articles. Certainly no reason for him not to get admin privileges. 
support,Has a solid plan for what he'd do with admin status and looks to be the sort of user who would benefit greatly from the ability to grab a mop and bucket on vandalism watch. 
support,'s statement does less than dissuade me (in fact my vote probably exemplifies ' rationale). This only suggests that is someone who looks to improve the functioning of a system the wiki in particular which I see as only beneficial. 
support,While I strongly disagree with his adminship proposal his edits and comments themselves are exemplary and indicate to me that he will use admin abilities well. 
support,Definitely reasonable and thoughtful. 
support,absolutely. Dedicated insightful contributes well to policy etc.. 
support,Per . 
support,A little low on the edits but I agree 100% with Jdforrester. 
support,Despite my disagreement with his proposal I think he has a generally good attitude and shouldn't be judged just on his one proposal. 
support,I disagree with his proposal but he was very civil throughout the entire discussion something I find as a mark of maturity. Making the proposal is certainly evidence he is willing to take the heat in order to improve Wikipedia which is also important. Objecting on the basis of his proposal is ludicrous. Disagree of course if you like but proposing something in obviously good faith is far from making him a bad admin candidate. 
support,You may not have too many edits but its quality over quantity 
oppose,He has a proposal developed whereby adminship would be granted according to what's apparently a simple good ol' boy system apparently without any voting at all. This sort of belief scares me as it suggests a lack of respect or faith in electing admins by community majorities in which everyone including nonadmins gets a vote. If he doesn't have any use for votes what does he need mine for? 
oppose,Oppose. One month shy of the ninemonth threshold and according to Kate's tool only has just over 1500 edits. 
oppose,With the exception of the one on votes which are evil I couldn't support anyone who does not generally embody Everyking's principles and points. 
oppose,i know its quality not quantity but at 653 article edits (1574 total) i dont think anyone could be experienced enough for admin duties. (sorry) 
support,Seems like a goody. 
support,Emphatic overwealming support! Ten has been extremely helpful to me personally and I haven't seen anything anywhere to suggest he wouldn't make a great admin. 
support,I have found that opposition by Everyking on the grounds of personal disagreement over admin actions is a good sign that the user is worth considering for adminship. 
support,We need diplomats.
support,Great user. 
support,Agree w/ Carnildo. Diplomatic and friendly comments like <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:TenOfAllTrades&oldid=14978213#Everyking> suggest Ten will make a great admin. 
support,would be a perfect admin 
support,Er what? Ten is not an admin already? My world hath been shattered! . 
support,I am proud to vote for him. 
support,Extremely Strong 
support,OMFG support. 
support,Cool. 
support,Thought he already was one. 
support,<nowiki>{{cliché}}</nowiki>. Ten's been involved with many aspects of Wikipedia. 
support,You mean he's not already? Oh dear. . 
support,Unequivocally. 
support,A reasonable person who does excellent work; happy to support. 
support,Good work. 
support,Sincerely I thought he was an admin already. . 
support,Of course. 
support,KingOfAllTrades 
support,My encounters with TenOfAllTrades have been entirely pleasant and productive. 
support,Have noticed a good approach to resolving disagreements. 
support,Well deserving of adminship especially lately. 
support,excellent editor and likely to make an excellent admin. 
support,I noticed him positively before (and liked his sense of humor too). His handling of the Everyking case El C cites below was appropriate. 
support,I've seen several occasions where Ten has been a calm voice of reason dealing with potentially difficult conflicts. And I thought Ten already was one. 
support,I can't say it better than those who came before. 
support,Seems like a great user. 
support,I've had positive encounters with this user in the past although slightly weak on edit count... I will support for admin. 
support,Consistently helpful and polite editor. 
support,Nothing but good experiences with this user. 
support,Contributions and Talk: page comments indicate good admin material. 
support,Looks good to me. 
support,support: Good to see the voting is going well for this reasoned and seasoned candidate. Noting Ten's POV seemed to be opposed to dissent from medical establishment authority it was refreshing to observe Ten's restraint rationality and efforts to make useful contributions thereafter. The ability to grow and overcome one's own bias is a remarkable and unusual quality for defenders of prevailing paradigms indicating Ten actually practices what he preaches about rationality. 
support,Very reasonable and I specifically recall his diplomacy on the talk page of the [[Thimerosol]] article. 
support,[[Image:Flag_of_Australia.svg|15px]] 
support,I've seen nothing but good faith efforts on his part. &middot; 
support,| [[User talk:Flcelloguy|A note? ]]</font color>| 
support,If El C's example of a "poor experience" with TenofAll is indicative how he handles disputes he's both an excellent contributor and decent with diplomacy. 
oppose,Poor experiences dealing with this user. 
support,plenty of edits and satisfactory answers. 
support,Good user. 
support,If he doesn't have time to use his powers will it really do any harm? The candidate's amount of time available to spend on Wikipedia in the future shouldn't be a primary consideration in granting or withholding admin powers.
support,good user reasons for opposition so far are weak at best. 
support,I simply had to oppose those who oppose on grounds of the user's lack of time. This is in my opinion one of the very worst reasons I see for opposing adminship. It does not mean that the project would not benefit from a user having sysop access nor does it imply that one is at all untrustworthy uncivil or not knowledegble about policy (although it may mean that these things take longer to show.) 
support,A part time trustworthy admin is worth having 
support,I actually like the honesty of admitting not having much time. Why is it that worse than people claiming that will fix everytihng on wikipedia even if they won't?(
support,Lot of dedication in vandal fighting
support,Harmless. And many an intention to concentrate on school in favor of Wikipedia has gone awry ;) 
support,user's on statements regarding lack of time show levelheadedness and honesty... passes my bar. 
support,deserves the recognition. 
support,I don't see how not having a lot of time to do stuff means that you should not get admin tools having lots of people fixing stuff now and again is surely healthier than having a few obsessives working flat out. A solid editor by all accounts. 
support,I think it's refreshing when a potential admin admits that he won't be on the Wikipedia 24/7. People who use that against him trouble me. Hot support. 
support,good admins are always useful even if they don't edit all that often. 
support,He can have the mop even if he doesn't use it much. 
support,Opposing due to warning that he won't be an active admin is new to me. There are several very good contributors here who have admin tools but don't use them much is one I can think of off the top of my head. The good work and experience is enough for me to support even though I haven't interacted with Thames much just reviewed his contributions. 
support,per Scimitar. 
support,Inactivity shouldn't be a problem. 
support,I don't understand the insufficient activity concerns. If an editor is suitable for the tools give them the tools. Another admin doing janitorial work once in a while is better than none at all right? 
oppose,Oppose (reluctantly): The answer to question 1 below is curious. You want to be an admin (you accepted the nom) but doubt you'll have time to do admin things? Why do you need the tools then? The things you say you'd like to spend time on do not need admin tools. Use of edit summaries is a touch lower than I like to see (59% overall 76% over last 500 edits) and activity level is a bit lower than I like to see (7 edits a day over last 90 days and that average has been slowly but steadily dropping for the last six months). Your intention of beginning a PhD program means this average will drop further. Also I am a bit concerned about possible overuse on your part of the {{tl|fairuse}} tag on various images that you have uploaded. About 1/4 of the images you've uploaded have been tagged with this tag which really shouldn't be used if possible. Lastly 352 of your last 500 edits have been marked as minor. Are you perhaps overusing the minor edit box? <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Collaborations_of_the_Week/Sixparty_talks&diff=prev&oldid=21366265 This edit> and <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Collaborations_of_the_Week/Sixparty_talks&diff=prev&oldid=20852456 this edit> for example do not seem minor to me (but I readily admit this is subjective). Convince me as to why you need/want admin tools when you won't be using them and I'll probably change my vote. All the best 
oppose,Oppose. User admits to not having the time to do admin chores. Also with the projects that he/she wants to be involved in no admin powers are needed. User is a good editor though. I will support when he/she is "ready". 
oppose,WHats the point of having admin powers if you don't have the time. And if you did't want to be nominated you could have just declined. 
support,[[First Post]]! seen this editor around and always thought he was sensible. Good egg in my estimation. 
support,active on talk pages and wikipedia namespace and uses edit summaries nicely which is a big plus. not likely to abuse admin tools.
support,Massive dose of support. He's pretty good. 
support,I went out on a limb in his last RfA and supported him. I thought I was going to be the only one. This time I already know I won't. I will however reiterate some of what I said then "Levelheaded? Check. Civil? Check... Heading in the right direction? Check. Can have (most) errors corrected? Check. No big deal? Check. I think I'll go out on a limb and support for now. Just do try and be more active." 
support,everything seems good. 
support,We need more admins watching where the money goes... I mean watching economic topics. 
support,We need more admins issues in last RfA seem addressed. 
support,Coming back from Wikibreak to support. [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,unlikely to abuse administrator tools. 
support,has proved himself. No big deal.
support,Seems like a good user from his edit history and what I've seen of him at AfC. 
support,A good contributor with well rounded contributions both with articles and with janitorial work. Looking through the contributions I see a responsible editor who I think would do well with the admin tools. 
support,&#8766; The Land is levelheaded reasonable and knowledgeable. Wikipedia will benefit from giving the mop and bucket to The Land. → 
support,Good editor.
support,Even though I have never worked with him the fact that he has had 500 edits since his last RfA is merit enough in my books. I didn't vote in his last RfA mostly because in October I was just starting to take interest in this side of Wiki. With that said I'd say let's go for it. 
support,Kinda disappointed he selfnommed (I could name half a dozen people who'd probably be happy to nominate him) especially so soon after his last RfA. That said he is a Top Bloke with a level head and the ability to shoot laser beams from his eyes so I don't really have any choice in the matter. . 
support,Probably was good enough last time just not active enough for people to see it. Under the circumstances waiting over a month to renominate is plenty long enough. 
support,Because he's always been a nice guy to me and we need more nice admins. 
support,oppose votes go against longstanding consensus that RfA renominations do not need to wait for arbitrary periods. 
support,Seems competent and sensible enough to use admin tools for good. 
support,seems like a good upstanding Wikipedian. So why wait to give him the mop.
support,In this user's previous RFA many opposed because The Land had been idle for a while and had a "low" edit count (hahaha). Now people are opposing because The Land after fixing those problems presented the solution "too soon". In both RFAs so far not one person has opposed for any other reason besides these two. Nobody has been able to come up with any reason why this user could not make perfectly good use of the extra abilities. 
support,[[Wikipedia:Esperanza|ε]]
support,Close but not too soon for me to oppose. Hmm that didn't come out right. 
support,per silsor. The Land had not a single oppose vote based on anything he did. He withdrew after a few days and waited almost seven weeks before renominating himself. He has shown fine judgment in biding his time and even if you think that an editor who has things to "fix" should hold off for 23 months to show improvement that seems to be inapplicable here. 
support,That he was turned down recently doesn't mean he has to be turned down now. 
support,as per [[user:Sjakkalle|Sjakkalle]]. 
support,as per last time. 
oppose,RfA's should not be reconsidered for 23 months 
oppose,barely over a month since last RfA. Am opposing now because I don't feel I'll get guff now. 
oppose,Nothing against the user but let's not set a precedent of quick reconsideration bids. Take a little time to work things out. 
oppose,For the reasons listed above and the low edit count. 
oppose,I do favor a longer waiting time between nominations but I'll be glad to support next nom. 
oppose,Too soon after last nom. 
oppose,too soon after previous nomination. No evidence of having addressed the criticism mentioned in that RFA. 
oppose,I feel pretty much the way the other opposers do not enough time to see if this user has taken previous criticism to heart. Perhaps in the future I will support... but not now. 
oppose,as selfnoms should be spaced further apart. Will most likely support in future but still too soon. 
oppose,need a little more time since last RFA. 
support,almost 6000 edits. 
support,Deserves adminship to better and more easily accomplish any task he chooses. Not every admin has to be a janitor or Walmart greeter. 
support,seems to have enough contributions and getting a contribution noted in a newspaper is a good thing too. 
support,The 'Badger has been around for a while and all my interactions with him have been positive. 
support,I believe this user won't go rogue with his admin powers. 
support,Does good work creating an encyclopedia; I can understand why he doesn't have time to muck about in the Wikipedia: namespace. :D 
support,Wholeheartedly support. I was one of those that offered a year ago to nominate Badger and I stand by that 100%. Badger is a fantastic editor and contributorI understand that the focus these days is on new admins who will do work on Wikipedia upkeep projects but back in the old days if we had a good editor who contributed a lot to the project and didn't cause trouble I recall us giving them admin privileges if they wanted them. I can foresee only benefits if we give Badger admin privilegesif for no other reason (and I can think of many others) than that a user who has made as many good wellwritten highquality contributions to this project as Badger has deserves to have that recognized. Adminship is supposed to be "no big deal"in a perfect world all wiki users would have admin privileges. We restrict them because there are people who will abuse the privileges I can't believe there's any concern about Badger in that respect. Sorry for the long note but I've been wanting to nominate this editor for a year and I can't believe there are so many oppose votes right now. 
support,Meets . 
support,Looks good to me. 
support,Good editor and a great username too. 
support,A user I recognize and respect. 
support,I decided to research him after I saw his nomination removed (strange that) and he seems like a good user. I hope I don't regret it! 
support,but if Hallett Smith is such a "noted Elizabethan scholar" shouldn't we have an article about him? 
support,first few oppose votes about setting up RfA wrong seem a bit harsh 
support,excellent editor would make a fine admin. 
support,A name I've seen associated with nothing but good edits. A longstanding good user ought to be given adminship even if he will use it only rarely: long experience without problems suggests he is suitably acquainted with policy despite lack of interest in its creation. 
support,An exemplary editor who deserves a mop even if it's for occasional use. 
support,The Musical Mustelidae has clarified my worry (personally being somewhat inclusionist if there's a chance that an article is under the apparent junk I was concerned that he might not scratch the surface before hitting the delete button). 
support,Not a very social person but a good article author and editor and we need people whose idea of content extends beyond format (as well as the people whose idea is format....not trying to pick another fight). In particular he satisfies a need as Wikipedia has too few folks working on Renaissance British literature. 
support,I'm also partial to people who mainly contribute content to the main article space. Everything I see is good and I see no reason to oppose. Excellent contributor. 
support,The only thing that might mitigate full support is the relative paucity of WP and WPTalk space edits (currently 44 and 4 respectively). However the quality of his (her?) work is so good and the interactions which I have seen so positive and thoughtful that I think this objection is easily overcome. This badger deserves all the accoutrements (s)he asks for.
support,Strong After perusing Kate's Tool looking at the classification of edits looking at his (yes you're a he!) user page/user talk page and looking at a (judicious) sampling of his edits over the last few months I have come to the conclusion that is correct. This is an editor that not only knows how to rewrite and expand articles (a complex task at times) but owns up to prior mistakes in article entries (and corrects them himself). He reverts obvious vandalism on sight when he sees it and gives room for not knowing everything about a topic (thinking gray: see my own user page for context). To top it off he has a very delightful sense of humor. Just because he is more interested in adding article content does not mean he does not know how to interact well with other editors (I've checked that too). Admins are trusted members who happen to have a set of tools at their disposal not perfect or allencompassing folks who participate in everything. . . I know I as an editor here follow my own fields of interest as does TSB. I see no reason not to promote him to Administrator status. He's been trustworthy to date. . . and he I believe will be trustworthy with the Admin buttons. Correcting the [[William Shakespeare]] article for his correct signature the one from his will is the icing on the cake for me. Knowledge gathering and contributing like TSB's are simply marvelous. Promote. 
support,as per . 
support,I apologize. I misunderstood your comment about the newspaper article which combined with the small amount of trouble you had formatting this RfA gave me a bad feeling. Since the issue of the article has been explained and based on UC's comment below I will support your request for admin powers. 
oppose,too few Wikipedia namespace edits. Also the problems you had with setting up this RfA show that you're not familiar enough with procedures yet to be an admin. Your edit count looks promising though and with a bit more participation in the community I'd definitely support in a month or two. 
oppose,Failure to follow instructions in submitting his self nomination <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_adminship&diff=22583866&oldid=22583777> shows a potential trait to not follow policies that admins need to know. Answers to question 1 below indicate desire to revert vandal behavior. I'm slightly concerned that in the last five months and 1000 edits this nominee has reverted edits a total 38 times or <4% of his edits (judging by edit summaries searching for "rv" and "revert"). Lastly over the last 100 edits edit summaries were not used in ~40% of edits. Show more interest in what it is you want to do as an admin use edit summaries more frequently and do your self nomination properly the next go around (if this one doesn't pass) and I'll gladly shift to support. 
support,despite whining about the Yukon being different. Lots of good edits lots of good category cleaning up work recently. Will wield the broom sensibly and is respectuful of consensus. Will be a good administrator. 
support,The Tom has been around for a while and has made nearly 8000 edits with a good spread over the talk and project namespaces. I'm very pleased with the category work he has been doing. The only complaint that I have is the lack of information on his userpage but that is just what I prefer to see. Otherwise I see no reason why The Tom shouldn't become an admin. 
support,but please use edit summaries more often. Also try to 'talk' more. You have only 69 usertalk edits about .9% of your total edits. 
support,No reason to believe that he can't be trusted with admin tools. 
support,8000 edits and a solid history with "janitorial" tasks; I can't hold the 200 edits against him when he was cleaning WP's house at the time. 
support,good record of janitorial work. 
support,work on those edit summaries but I don't think that should ever be a reason not to support someone. Just because it's harder to evaluate the editor? Other than that a lack of edit summaries aren't a good enough reason to vote oppose when being an admin is no big deal.
support,Use Edit summaries! Ohterwise Gator is right being an admin is no big deal. Good luck!
support,Always being sensible at [[WP:CFD]]. 
support,seems like a good and dedicated editor. 
oppose,I don't know this user personally but from looking at his <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&target=The_Tom&offset=0&limit=250 last 200 edits> it is very hard to find an instance when The Tom put an [[edit summary]] and just a bit more often he uses the minor edit button. 
support,Strong as nominator 
support,I'm surprised he isn't already an admin having recently met the chap I can report that he is a dedicated and enthusiastic editor with an excellent knowledge of the wikiverse.

support,Should've been an admin months ago; I really should check to make sure people like him actually get nominated when they deserve it. Kudos to Cyberjunkie for seeing that that happens. 
support,Them Aussies are taking over. Uruguay then the Windies next... Wikipedia! 
support,Now that I have met Bainer and he knows what I look like it may not be wise/safe to vote against him. Fortunately he is a very good contributer who will probably be an excellent admin.

support,Sumasangayon I mean . Yes you're more than qualified plus we need more Pinoy admins. :D 
support,! He's a great editor answered the questions very well (2000 pages on your watchlist?! Wow!) and he's given me a lot of help with Philippinesrelated articles. Plus his contributions for the cities articles are a very huge task for one nonbot editor to do. I was somewhat surprised to find he wasn't an admin.

support,I too haven't really crossed paths with Thorpe but it looks like he's a good editor...he won't abuse the admin tools IMHO. 
support,Mais bien sûr! 
support,A very industriuous thorough and committed editor whose enthusiastic vandal defence would surely benefit from rollback. I am impressed that Thryduulf explicitly drew attention to my comment about his recent intervention with an uncommunicative editor. I believe that his handling of that case was inappropriately harsh but it was only just so; I understand how he got into that position and it is clear from his response to previous suggestions/criticisms that he learns fast and is unlikely to repeat that error (as I see it). 
support,not one already? I have been particularly impressed with his work on the Village Pump and the way he participates in policy issues like [[Wikipedia:Content labeling proposal]]. 
support,Thryduulf makes a good balance of contributions to articles talk pages and policy issues. Happy to support. 
support,A wellrounded editor. 
support,I just had occasion to single xim out for praise and now this. Seems like an omen. 
support,I've seen Thryduulf involved with many edits and discussion in the main and Wikipedia namespaces and was just thinking today that he should be in line for an adminship soon. May the sockpuppets fall trampled beneath the Earth! 
support,enthusiastically. What everyone else said. 
support,Not an admin already?

support,This user is a good active contributor to Wikipedia and has made important contributions to Computer and video games article groups. Evidence of good communication and civility shown on talk pages. I do not hesitate to vote that this user should be given administrative privileges; I am sure that this user will make good use of them.

support,Based on the overwhelming support I support as well "
support,Okay. 
support,THWAAA. A very constructive editor who has contributed some excellent articles. 
support,I don't really think that sparsely using edit summaries should keep anyone from being an admin especially such a strong editor.

support,this user has left me with a good impression every time I've encountered him. Just venture a little bit more into the Wikipedia namespace every once in a while. 
support,plenty of experience went through his archives and cant find any scandals. 
support,9000 edits in a year is most impressive.[[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,as per nom. 
support,Yes 
support,I have ran into him before and in each case he was either reverting vandals making good edits or engaging in civil discourse.
support,[[WP:ESP|e]]
support,although I don't know 'em. 
support,That's hot. 
support,It's been a pleasure working with him on various articles and was one of the first individuals that helped point me in the right direction when I was a newbee. Will make a fine admin. 
support,Won't abuse admin powers. 
support,King of all supports. His contributions to Wikipedia are immense. He has a lot of talk page edits (every talk page I visit seems to have a post from him on it). That is amazing. I probably see Tom on talk pages more than anybody else. He is civil knowledgable helpful and extends a hand to everyone who asks for it. Hats off friend. 
support,Over 9000?? this should be clear... 
support,Not come across him but a brief look at his contributions looks good and I trust the other supporters. 
support,I think he's "mopworthy".
support,He's handled disagreements I have had with him in very civil terms. I also like his strong support of [[Wikipedia:Remove personal attacks]] 
support,Wow thought he was one already. Unquestionable. 
support,for now. After more research about the things Everyking has pointed out I may change my vote. 
support,100% Damn fine editor damn fine person and he'll make a damn fine admin. 
support,Strongest Possible. In my experience Tony has been incredibly hardworking and has displayed an almost uncompromisingly openminded and positive attitude. I knew he's been involved in content disputes and although some may disagree with him (they were quite contentious disputes) I hope all can agree that he was often the force behind resolving disputes when all the rest (including myself on occasion) were frustratingly and unproductively at a stalemate. He has a great knowledge of the policies and procedures of Wikipedia. Unlike User:Jag123 I perceive his edits to consist both of talk page discussion as well as many substantive namespace contributions. 
support,I strongly disagree with some positions he's taken in particular those regarding explicit pictures; but I've got strong opinions too and it doesn't stop me from properly doing the dirty work of cleaning up the little turds the trolls children and morons leave behind. I'll fight him on "remove personal attacks" and I'll fight him on explicit pictures but that's irrelevant to adminship. 
support,He's not already an...? Yeah.... 
support,Nobrainer support. 
support,Looks like a goody support 
support,Strongly 
support,Wait he's not an admin? Well give that boy a mop and bucket and put him to work. Fairminded to a fault he'll do a great job. 
support,I don't see any reason not to support. The incidents that have been mentioned seem to be few relative to the number of edits. 
support,At the risk of being unoriginal I thought he was. 
support,he has always shown good faith and is a fine user. 
support,Good user. 
support,Good user with excellent knowledge of how the Wikipedia works. I don't think that he should be opposed for 1) his opinion on the inclusion of possibly offensive images or 2) his acknowledgement that the Wiki environment can be agonizingly frustrating for actual domain experts. 
support,Strongly He has always tried to keep an open mind in edit discussion tried to compromise and reach consensus in NPOV tried to resolve issues rather than revert to edit war. I think he cares about the integrity and future of Wikipedia and has a firm grasp of the concept of the encyclopedia. The reasons levied in opposition to this nomination do not hold water to me; I have seen him repeatedly trying to avoid negativism and try to work with others.
support,Eh why not. 
support,He has strong views and speaks his mind. And? He gets involved in contentious issues to resolve disputes not further them. He is courteous more often than I am (and I try). He already holds himself to higher standards than is required by policy and I presume will be even more careful as an admin. He does a lot of janitorial work around here and seems ready to take on more. Hey hand him a mop and bucket. 
support,Sure. 
support,I could have sworn Tony Sidaway was an admin but since he isn't he should certainly be made one. 
support,Had a somewhat unpleasant runin with him recently but the problem was sorted out on the talk page rather quickly and politely. While I don't always agree with him I believe I can trust him with the additional admin powers. 
support,I thought $user was already an admin. 
support,Even though Tony and I have had stark differences on a few issues here or there I respect his opinion and intellect and offer him my most fervent support.
support,I've seen him around for some time and his judgement seems sound. 
support,While I tend to disagree with him many issues and often end up debating him I still think he would make a fine administrator. 
support,A sensible editor for the most part. No problems whatever with handing over the keys. 
support,Excellent. 
support,Not that my vote is needed at this point but support. 
support,definitely. 
support,I would trust Tony to be playing with those toys a lot more than I do some people who already can. 
support,Every time I had interactions with him or even saw his work from a distance Tony seemed a reasonable moderate coolheaded person. He constantly displayed the qualities and attitudes which I have come to expect from administrators and I daresay from good ones. 
support,On the whole I think he does good work and acts in good faith and makes an effort to address concerns. 
support,I'm rather suprised to learn that he's not an admin already. 
support,I don't know Tony very well but what I've seen of him (mostly on the mailing list I'll admit) makes me share some of the concerns of the oppose voters above. I am partially of the opinion that Tony may be a very fine contributor who for whatever reason is too consistently hardline and unwilling to compromise to be an effective admin. We have a number of editors whose contributions dwarf mine (Tony is likely one of these) but who don't have an admin temperament and I think they should be valued but not promoted. That said I don't know Tony well enough to be sure about this so I won't oppose and certainly many people whose judgment I trust support his nomination so perhaps I am simply jumping to a wrong conclusion. 22:50 8 Mar 2005 (UTC) After posting my neutral vote however Tony left me a few comments on my talk page that I have considered. I've also had a brief spin through his recent contributions. Tony strikes me as a generally quality Wikipedian whose opinions I often do not share but whose fundamental commitment to this site is easily the equal of mine. I cannot therefore do anything but support him I would caution him to be very selfaware about areas where his strong opinions may cloud his judgment (and to be careful when dealing with "semipolicies") but that's good advice for anybody and shouldn't pose a serious obstacle to his being a productive admin. Sorry for the novel. Best wishes Tony. 
support,support 
support,if anyone can be deemed to have served their "apprenticeship" it's Tony and I can't imagine anyone who deserves it more. 
support,I'm an infrequent RfA voter but the apparently baseless opposition and especially the complaint that he agrees with close to 40% of those voting on the inline photo make it mandatory that i vote on this one. 
oppose,Very strongly oppose based on my experience in dealing with him: tendency to get involved in disputes uncompromising and negative attitude support for explicit pictures displayed on articles (as opposed to being linked—the dispute over [[autofellatio]] being perhaps the most notable example) a stated belief that Wikipedia is no place for knowledgeable experts to work alongside ordinary contributors and extreme deletionism. 
oppose,Posts to wikienl suggest he would take a heavy hand as an admin (see <http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikienl/2005February/018858.html> for example). Other posts to wikienl indicate an arrogant and condescending attitude. (see <http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikienl/2005February/019670.html> for example). These examples are by no means isolated but I'm not going to spend any more time digging through the wikienl archives looking for more. I recognize Tony's numerous contributions but I don't want someone with his attitude with the "mop and keys". 
oppose,Oppose 
oppose,Extremely strongly oppose. Agree very much with James Everyking's analysis. If a user was doing this on purpose you'd call him a troll. This is in no way based on my disagreement with him on one issue or another I wouldn't oppose him for that but for his anticonsensual approach and the character flaws James mentions.
oppose,Oppose. Posting a gawdawful picture of [[autofellatio]] to see how long it would last seems awfully close to disrupting wikipedia to prove a point. Moreover user nonchallantly speaks of forking the project and writing articles for "stability" rather than consensus. I find consensus to be a nonnegotiable value for the project and am hesitant to support a user that feels differently. 
oppose,Oppose. No pun intended but his behaviour at autofellatio left a bad taste in my mouth and is far too close to being disruptiveinordertomakeapoint than I'm comfortable in endorsing in an administrator. (P.S. The autofellatio article still sucks....) 
oppose,Oppose. Agreement with Everyking. 
oppose,Oppose but not gladly. I think Tony has a bit of work to do before I'd support his nomination. His tone is at times aggressive in a way that I don't think appropriate for an admin especially given to whom its been addressed. 
oppose,/ 
oppose,at this time. He answered many requests to move articles in WP:RM only with the curt reply "pointless move". That just doesn't seem helpful to the requestor. He does seem to be a generally good editor in most other ways however so I may support in future. 
oppose,Oppose. Too soon maybe in a few months. 
oppose,Oppose. I see some benefit in making him an admin but I also agree with Everyking Jonathunder and Cool Hand Luke. 
support,Extreme first support vote. I was going to nominate him myself but I am a lazy slacker and I kept forgetting. Sorry. 
support,This user has put in an amazing number of edits (not to fall victim to editcountitis but over 16000 edits shows strong commitment to the project). I don't see any problems with giving Tregoweth the mop.

support,looks reasonable enough. 
support,by all means 
support,Have a mop. It'll come in handy. 
support,his name pops up on my watchlist quite often good editor. 
support,This is my 2000th edit. You better make it worthwhile. Don't go all crazy on us now. 
support,looks like a worthwhile contributer no reason not to. 
support,Would benefit with the rollback tool. 
support,Normally I like to see more WP space edits but his edit history looks good. 
support,has shown himself to be a trustworthy editor who would benefit from adminship. 
support,Seems alright to me. 
support,Impressive articlespace credentials. 
support,Solid contribution record. 
support,ITHAWO. 
support,Meets . Simple as. 
support,Cool. 
support,I know this user from a mini caba...err...TINC... 
support,a great contributor. 
support,Sure everything looks good for this potential admin. Remember there is no cabal. Really. 
support,I like how he organized his talk and archive pages so much I boldly stole part of the format. 
support,Sure I'll support. But please add a user page template of some kind to the top of your user page it's a bit too much like the Main Page IMHO. 
support,I support although I would like to see more wikiinteraction. Visiting the COTW or TWID would be nice but of course it isn't a requirement. You have a good amount of edits and we need more admins good a cleanup. 
support,I think the project is a wothwhile intitiative and has been conducted with respect for other editors by using humans to edit articles detected by the scripts and encouraging collaboration to improve the wikipedia.
support,There are many ways to contribute significantly to Wikipedia besides authoring articles and in only five months I see quite significant contributions by Triddle including a slew of images and his creation of the [[Wikipedia:WikiProject help desk|WikiProject help desk]] which demonstrates his constructive and helpful attitude. Admin privileges would allow him be an even greater asset to the project. 
support,Hey! I would have nominated you. To some extent I think good diligent cleanup work is more adminworthy than any amount of prose. Otherwise what good are the tools? But maybe that's just because I'm selfconscious about my own prose. Triddle will use his admin powers wisely. 
support,Good contributor. 
support,Great image contributions I've found them very useful. 
support,Good article contributions and stubsensor is very useful. 
support,Does good work and I see no evidence that he would misuse admin rights. 
support,User shows good evidence of trustworthiness this is all that is needed for my support. 
support,I have some experience with Triddle and as far as I am concerned he is a polite and pondered editor. His project is also a very good initiative. I believe he would make a mighty good admin. 
support,(no qualification). 
support,Does very good work great addition. 
support,agree with all of above. 
support,No trouble with Triddle. 
support,appears to know policy no evidence he would go on a vandalism spree once promoted. 
support,Excellent contributor to cleaning up wikipedia which is imo the main sole of admins. Hates invalid stub notices => axiomatically good person. 
oppose,Although there are a large number of cleanup edits there are very few if any substantial article contributions. It is thus impossible to judge the potential behaviour of this editor when it came to conflicts and thus there is insufficient information to determine whether they are trustworthy. I am not keen on the balance of editing according to Kate's tool either. 
support,I happily offer my support. Good luck! oo64eva (AJ) (
support,Happy to be one of the first to support this.

support,Excellent easygoing contributor. 
support,I always liked [[trilobite]]s. And 's ancestors. OK seriously I've run into Trilobite often and seen him doing good work especially tackling vandalism. He'll make a great administrator. (Although he could use edit summaries a bit more often.) 
support,I see this name all over the place always doing good work. Easy support. 
support,Easy decision. 
support,valuable and very well experienced contributor. 
support,good resume with no signficant negatives. 
support,great contributor and janitor
support,great arthropod. 
support,definitely. I've seen good contributions all over and good evidence of communicating and working well with others.

support,why the hell not?

support,unlikely to abuse administrator tools. 
support,most definitely. 
support,Hell yes!!! 
support,seems an excellent Wikipedian the few times our paths have crossed. I feel confident he would make a great admin. └
support,Strongest Possible. He does a lot of work and so what if a lot of edits are to user talk? He still passes the bar in other spaces what would you support if he had 500 LESS talk edits? User talk edits means he interacts well. But anyways why'd he wait so long to run? He supported my RfA 4 and a haalf months ago and he already had 4000 edits! [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]

support,per nom. 
support,Looks to have a good interaction with the community. Can not see a reason to oppose but I see quite a few reasons to support. 
support,One of those 'I thought he was an admin' cases at least for me Mop'n'bucket power to him!
support,Who? Oh Tomer! Definite support then! 
support,Plenty of talk page interaction and uses edit summaries.
support,Unlikely to abuse admin tools likely to do good work. From what I remember a little too much tendency to stir shit up for the heck of it on talk pages (I hope that's not a case of mistaken identity in my saying that) but I don't see that as having a bearing on being an admin since none of it has been meanspirited. 
support,Strong Much good work already more to come I'm sure. 
support,Good user who could well benefit from the mop and bucket. 
support,A fine editor who actually explains what he is doing on the talk pages. 
support,Go for it 
support,Fair and fine. 
support,Solid editor who has displayed a good sense of fairness in all situations I have observed. 
support,agree with those who thinks that discussing edits is a plus. &larr;
support,WTH I had to look too hard to find this user on the RFA page damnit! 
support,how'd I miss this before? 
support,keep up the good work! 
support,Free drugs!

support,Of course. 
support,Good job kid. 
support,Would be glad to have you back.

support,thoughtful and reasonable whenever I've encountered him. 
support,100% Great person to work with 
support,Was wondering when you'd finally give in! 
support,of course but as Raul says it's standard to let people take up their status again if they requested it be taken away in the first place. 
support,I'm kinda pissed off that he's not still beaurocrat...
support,I thought I had already voted support for him. I guess not. ! | 
support,SUPPORT. 
support,Cool. 
support,Great contributor IMO 
support,Of course. 
support,Of course. 
oppose,Oppose. Based on [[User_talk:FeloniousMonk#Current_comments_by_other_editors|my past interactions]] with him I have doubts that he can distinguish between actual bad behavior and the responses of those wronged respond to it adequately and remain neutral. 
oppose,See [[Wikipedia:Requests for comment/RickK]]. 
support,Looks good. [[User Talk:Acetic Acid|Acetic]]
support,strongly! Over 200 vandalized pages reverted in the last week alone not counting numerous nonsense pages speedydeleted away. This guy is a vandalfighting machine...imagine what he can do for us with the Rollback and Block buttons enabled! We need more people like Ulayiti.

support,Excellent contributor. 
support,<p style="fontfamily: Comic sans Comic Sans MS monospace;">
support,emphatically. 
support,Only halfheartedly support (Just kidding. What do you think I vote?) 
support,I really though he was one! 
support,of course. (assuming acceptance) I'd thought he got through last time. Hmm. 
support,The only reason I opposed him last time was the user page. I guess what he has now will work and I've seen him around more. 
support,of course. He should had been made an admin way long ago. 
support,The user page question seems academic really. 
support,The userpage flap was silly then and it's silly now. 
support,Previous nom says it all.
support,As I said last time I have seen Uncle G's work and it seems like he is a hard worker and janitor. He has also been a diligent admin on [[wiktionary:Main Page|Wiktionary]] and [[wikinews::Main Page|Wikinews]] and I think being an admin here too would be a huge benefit for all of us. 
support,red link issue is gone therefore absolutely no reason to object. 
support,red link issue is gone and it wasn't a reason to object last time anyway. 
support,A good user active on vfd and has a lot of good contibutions. 
support,just as before. 
support,I count his experience on sister projects as a major plus for Wikipedia! 
support,One of the top Wikipedians. 
support,I like the way this man thinks. I happily support now that the pesky red link of yore has been fixed. 
support,excellent contributor both levelheaded and patient. 
support,although ~7500 edits (~4000 in the articlespace) just barely squeaks by for me. Just kidding. Uncle G has a huge amount of knowledge of Wikipedia procedures and contributes to many areas. 
support,If he doesn't accept force him into servitude. 
support,Excellent editor intelligent and patient. Will undoubtedly put admin abilities to good use. 
support,A great contributor that should have passed the previous nomination 
support,Should have passed the first time. 
support,I am satisfied that Uncle G is probably not an axemurderer. 
support,as I did last time. 
support,active in areas that benefit from adminship. 
support,Emphatic assuming he accepts the nomination. Levelheaded with a great knowledge of Wikipedia procedure that of sister projects and of stuff in general. 
support,Strong a strong candidate with plenty of solid contributions especially to VfD. Uncle G has contributed some of the alltime great VfD votes such as <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Chewbacca_Defense> which was so good it was later preserved on BJAODN. I'm a bit concerned that Uncle G hasn't accepted his nomination yet but I see no reason not to vote (an nonacceptance will obviously void all votes anyway). 
support,excellent contributor and likely to be an equally excellent admin. 
support,Thorough knowledgeable source whom I also thought was already an admin! 
support,Benefit of the doubt. 
support,as before. 
support,Excellent wikipedian. We need more like him. 
support,Duh. 
support,of course. (I'd merely be waiting for Uncle to say yes.) 
support,Strong contributions to the community. 
support,My objections have been assuaged. 
support,Good contributor even if he dislikes Bible verses. 
support,but I'd really prefer it if he'd find the few minutes to answer the questions. I'd also express some concern over some recent VfD examples (e.g. citing <http://www.nicecupofteaandasitdown.com www.nicecupofteaandasitdown.com> as an encyclopedic source) but the overwhelming majority of what Uncle G does is impressively thorough good work. And I'm sure his administries on other Wikis will be of use here too. 
support,My only concern prior was having an admin with no user page but I am impressed that Uncle G was willing to listen to a large segment of the community who was bothered by this and create one despite his personal feelings about it demonstrating his collaborative good will. 
support,After accepting the nomination I support wholeheartedly 
support,moved my vote from Neutral following Uncle G's acceptance of nom. 
support,If/When Since Uncle G has now acceptsed I will be am more than happy to vote support adminship for a valuable Wikipedian that puts principals before power (now if only this was a request for presidency of a large nation in the western hemisphere...). 
support,changed vote from neutral. Seems like he would make a valuable admin. | [[User talk:Flcelloguy|A note? ]]</font color>| 
support,now that this excellent contributor has a user page. 
support,He's done great work on [[Wikipedia:Criteria for speedy deletion/Proposal]]. 
support,Moved from neutral. I am satisfied with his answers below. 
support,moved from neutral since he does he indeed accept. 
oppose,Far too concerned with deletion rather than contribution. His user page is as useless as the previous red link so I don't see any improvement in that regard considering the [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Uncle G|feedback he got before]]. 
oppose,Oppose. Nomination is three months premature. 
oppose,Strongly 
oppose,too shorttempered in many dealings with many editors. 
oppose,His not accepting or rejecting the nomination nor answering the questions after three days just pushes me (somewhat reluctantly) over from neutral to weak oppose. It's no good saying that he's busy writing an encyclopædia if he wants to stay busy doing that he doesn't need to be an admin. 
oppose,My only interaction was extremely negative so I must oppose not having seen anything to change my mind. 
oppose,Too many negative interactions with too many good contributors. 
oppose,Strong oppose overly prone to using VFD; concerning Bible versesgroup VFD I would say abuses it. 
oppose,A bully. 
support,Nominator obviously supports.

This is not only suspesious but against RfA guidlines. This is possible trolling warranting RfC. I wonder if the beaurocrates even count such silly votes. This is just ridiculous. (sic) (<http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ARedwolf24&diff=26133107&oldid=26132596>) As far as I'm concerned I would prefer admin candidates not to call someone a possible troll. Not only will this usually flame a conflict but it may be considered a [[WP:NPA|personal attack]]. Though I don't agree with Boothy's votes he is a respected Wikipedian in good standing and should not be called a troll. The rest of the comment along with his response to Boothy's vote above also makes me hesistant. While it's OK to question Boothy's votes (many have done so and I'm sure many will do so in the future) it's certainly not OK to call someone a troll. Combined with a low edit count percentage and diminishing edits on the project (see the chart; your overall contributions have leveled off since 9/16) I just don't think you're ready yet. You're a great Wikipedian VOA so please don't be discouraged by my comments. If this RfA fails (which it looks like it won't) I'd gladly support you in the future.

support,excellent user. 
support,a very enthusiastic janitor; needs keys to the cleaning closet. 
support,looks like he will make a great admin. 
support,He's already been doing the cleanup a nonadmin can do and is exceptionally good about doing due diligence. He's got a level head good judgement and errs on the side of caution. All good qualities for an admin. &rarr; 
support,Strong a top bloke amongst top blokes. Works hard for the encyclopaedia keeps a level head learns from his mistakes. 
support,Good editor. 
support,I've taken a look at a few of your edits and it seems you really grind away at this project we like to call Wikipedia. Here's to hoping you don't snap and start blocking everyone on Wikipedia eventually becoming so powerful as an admin that you outblock Jimmy Wales. Whoops there goes my imagination again. 
support,I've had good experiences working with W.marsh resolving disputes before they became significant.
support,a good vandal fighter and experienced too. 
oppose,a few bad run ins with this fellow. Not admin material. 
oppose,per Zordrac. 
support,Of course! 
support,I'm happy to support. 
support,Cool. 
support,seems levelheaded 
oppose,Needs a bit more time interacting and getting involved with Wikipedia: discussions to learn the ropes. Recent <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&hideminor=0&namespace=4&target=Waltpohl&limit=500&offset=0 Star Trek episode delete voting> leaves me worried he's not clear on inclusion standards. 
oppose,Agree with Netoholic. Wikipedia is not lacking in admins.
support,as the nom 
support,for no obvious reason. 
support,He has shown a firm understanding of our policies and I am sure he will use the tools wisely. Copyediting is a vastly underrated task in Wikipedia Wayward is a prime example of a user making a very valuable contribution without necessarily adding reams of content. 
support,copyediting is more relevant to administrating than writing is. 2000 edits is more than enough. 
support,Good editor. Give him a mop. 
support,Copyediting is a muchneeded task and users shouldn't be looked down on for focusing on it. 
support,[[WP:ESP|e]]
support,Stereotyping "acceptable editing behaviors" for adminship seems counterproductive. Besides Wikipedia needs better writing more than it needs new articles. 
support,Seems unlikely to cause destruction. 
support,(
support,Good candidate. Nice to see a normal editor for a change. 
support,so long as you work on using more usertalk especially in dealing with vandals
oppose,An admin should ideally contribute more to articles than simple copyediting. I think more experience of writing articles from scratch or contributing to existing articles is necessary attribute for an admin. 
oppose,[[Opera|Oppose]] Same reason as given by Astrotrain. 
oppose,An admin should not regularly violate Wikipedia policy. In this case the nominee's besetting sin is a lack of respect for previous editors' national spelling. Examples: <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Acetic_acid&diff=24039785&oldid=24031266> <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Makuria&diff=22213691&oldid=22197359> <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Human&diff=prev&oldid=23095360>

support,Obviously. 
support,Definitely. 
support,yupsireebobfersure. 
support,Who works extraordinarily hard on extraordinarily dull but important tasks. He takes some flak for it quite regularly and responds easily and with a knowledgable backing in policy. It's just a pity that he can't finish off what he starts yet. It'd also be great to speed his vandal fighting which he is already very effective at. Will Who benefit the Wiki with the admin buttons? Oh yes most certainly. As an added bonus we have a rare case of a rhyming RfA pagetitle. 
support,Of course. 
support,As distracting as those damn question marks are I don't think they'll affect your judgment as an admin in any negative way. [[User Talk:Acetic Acid|Acetic]]

support,An obvious as long as he accepts the nomination (which I'm sure he will since he said he would.) 
support,[[soup|]] Sure why not? 
support,I seem to remember seeing this user somewhere. 
support,lots of image work and user interaction seems civil. No evidence of campaigning (which I've only just realised creates difficulties for me). 
support,though I haven't seen this user around. 
support,[[WP:ESP|e]]
support,I checked out a bunch of his edits to User Talk pages and was uniformly impressed with how he dealt with other people. I'm still trying to figure out why [[User talk:Nichalp|«Talk»=]] stepped in and answered my question for the candidate (see below); I was interested in how the candidate answered not a third party but that won't stop me from giving my support to what looks like a fine candidate. 
support,I liked <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Wikiacc&diff=23073844&oldid=23072124 this comment> on your talk page. Seem to be able to keep a cool head a highly valued quality in my books.

support,I met user here <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Post_Pattern> from what I've seen Wikibofh seems to be a conscientious user. 
support,Good admin material. 
support,!!! 
support,Cool. 
support,nice editor. 
support,obviously pending answers to questions. 
support,You're not allowed to beat the nominator to it! (**blocks NSLE indefinitely**) 
support,of course. 
support,This user has greatly improved as a community member and I think he's ready for the mop and broom. 
support,Good User 
support,Good user active on IRC and would make a good admin. Will be easy to contact when an admin is needed. I think WikiFanatic will make a really good admin. Have a look at WikiFanatic's contributions and you will find many reasons to vote support like me. Also it would help if WikiFanatic could delete pages as WikiFanatic is involved a bit with closing afd's 
support,Hey he nominated me. One good turn deserves another. He's improved a vast amount over the past few months and he's always on IRC to help anyone who needs it. His only real weakness IMO is that he's too nervous but after this start I think that'll be changing soon. 
support,this user is unlikely to abuse the admin toolbox. 
support,yeeeah. 
support,Good contributor. 
support,Ayup. Good contributions. [[Image:Flag of Austria.svg|15px]] 
support,looking good but ramp up the editing a notch would ya? 
support,ooh how exciting! [[user:Celestianpower|Cel]][[WP:ESP|e]]
support,who cares about edit counts? 
support,What the heck. You opposed me (the only one to do so) but Im not one to hold a grudge and I believe that you can do it. 
support,I don't care how long he's been an editor or how many edits he has I have interacted with him quite a bit both on the wiki and on IRC and I trust him not to abuse the extra tools if given to him. 
support,[[Wikipedia:Esperanza|ε]]
support,Everything seems in order ;> </big> ([[User_Talk:Vilerage|Reply]]|[[Special:Emailuser/Vilerage|Spam Me!]]
support,Despite low edits WikiFanatic has shown his dedication to the project and improved significantly since the last time he was up for nomination. After talking to him on IRC I have no objections to speak of. 
support,Need more admins. 
support,Never been a fan of editcountitis. Quality over quanity. 
support,That's hot. 
support,yup. 
support,Definately. 
support,as per Ral315. 
support,[[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,Eh sure. We had a long conversation on IRC about what he does what he's done and what he can do and I'm persuaded. 
support,as a person I know he can be annoying at times(especially on irc) but on wikipedia He is perfectly capable of handling the admin tasks he's requested. Many of the oppose'ers are going on his edit counts or his actual edits. granted they may not always be perfect but for doing basic cleanup of people who put "OMG WHAT A FAG" on pages and closing AfD's I find him perfectly fit for doing so. 
support,! 
support,Just saw how quickly he created the his other contributions are good too. 
support,Contribs show no obvious signs of insanity and reasonable judgement on AFD cases. Dedicated and enthusiastic and not overly involved in controversy and so on. 
support,We're always in need of more young knowledgeable admins. Good times. 
support,after a small interview with WikiFanatic he appears to be capable of this administrator position. The best of luck to him.
support,We need more admins not less.
support,For a dedicated contributor to become an admin should not be a big deal. Stop worrying about it and be a good admin. 
support,WikiFanatic has improved a lot since I last looked over his contribs. WikiFanatic does have a few personal issues which have led to some issues relating to civility and interpersonal relations but generally and for the most part he is a very good wellmeaning fellow even though he does have (as we all do) our darker moments. Indeed he has worked around those issues to an exemplary degree in recent times. He has as evidenced by his contributions done good work around the wiki on many occasions and has more recently demonstrated a good level of responsibility and judgement. I do think that since adminship is such a minor matter it would be quite wrong to deny this user administrator privileges. 
support,Looking over his contributions looks like he makes good helpful edits and would make a good administrator. 
support,support needs to RC patrol even more tho :P 
support,no compelling reason to oppose. 
support,Weak I said I would support him several months later if he didn't flip out in the interim and here we are. So... 
support,Definitely. 
support,He's a good user on the other wiki I go to. 
support,Same with me good user on other wiki awesome guy in general very responsible..etc. 
support,Strong edits and same as the users above me. 
support,Long history on Wikipedia likely to use admin tools effectively. 
support,knowledgeable and helpful user exactly what an admin should be. [[User talk:YixilTesiphon|Say hello]] 
oppose,1355 edits in over 18 months is not very much. I don't care if he's active on IRC. IRC is not Wikipedia. 
oppose,exactly what I was thinking too little edits in over a year and a half. 
oppose,I just don't think he's ready yet. He's still going around with this "Well ... did ... to me you should do ... to ...." stuff.. 
oppose,Nothing about my interactions with this user who is an IRC regular suggests that he is adequately prepared to handle the mop and broom. 
oppose,Having examined this user's contributions they do not achieve the level required of adminstrators. For example on [[History of Mississippi]]. While this was two months ago and <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Samkon_Gado&diff=prev&oldid=28366324 later> edits show he now understands the basics I am simply not seeing enough to convince me. 
oppose,Weak oppose. It feels to me like we are applying a lower standard to WikiFanatic because he is active on IRC. I'm sure he's a nice guy but that feels really really ethically wrong to me. We've rejected admin candidates with more edits and experience and I feel like WF is getting a pass here because people like hanging out with him. We should judge people based on their contributions on the wiki not based on whether we enjoy hanging out with them on a chat system. Collegiality is important but I don't see the standard being reached here. Sorry. 
oppose,due to lack of experience needs more time. 
oppose,Clearly a wellmeaning and enthusiastic contributor but unfortunately a bit unpredictable. The bulk of my experience with WikiFanatic has occurred on IRC from which he is regularly banned for being a mild pest. I have no doubt that he has the potential to make a fine administrator but he seems not to have reached that point yet. 
oppose,as per Phroziac. 
oppose,as per brenneman. 
oppose,Not enough edits. And IRC is NOT Wikipedia. 
support,On balance I think this user's contributions are overwhelmingly positive. At one time I was a bit irritated by what I thought were superfluous prefaces added to articles about every political party he could find defining what a political party is but as I've seen more of his work I've realized that this is a user that we need to see more of. By the way he's a Dutch politician the only professional politician that I've seen in Wikipedia and as such brings muchneeded inside knowledge of the political field. 21:23 13 Apr 2005 (UTC) (BTW: I am not a professional politican by profession but am and was an elected official inside resp. an European political party (Bureau member [[ELDR]]) and a Dutch party (international secretary [[D66]].

support,This should be no big deal. 
support,support. 
support,&#8212;
support,I do agree you're a great user. But you see the rectangular box that says "edit summary" below the edit box? I cannot support you until you put information in there for most of your edits. [[User talk:Lst27|(talk)]] 22:00 13 Apr 2005 (UTC) Ok. Sounds good enough to me. 
support,Strange... I'm agreeing almost word for word with Everyking... It's a pity though because other than the edit summaries Wilfried seems to be a very fine editor. Given Wilfried Derksen's assurance that he will start using edit summaries I'm changing my vote. (Hm I'm trusting a politician here 
support,Productive editor.
support,Edit summaries are important they save people on RC patrol a lot of time. I'm not going to oppose such a good user for this reason alone but at this time a cannot support either. If this small matter is fixed I will most definitely support next time. In light of the assurances made by Wilfried I am now willing to support. 
support,Excellent user but I find the lack of edit summaries very disturbing. | [[User talk:Zzyzx11|Talk]] 23:26 13 Apr 2005 (UTC). Wilfried Derksen assured that he will use edit summaries more so therefore I will support him. 
support,A fine editor who will be made finer with the keys to the kingdom! 
support,He has shown his suitability by making a conscious effort to improve himself and the quality of his contributions. 
support,Edit summaries are handy and to some extent important but I can't condone witholding adminship from an otherwisegreat editor on that basis alone. 
support,though I suggest sticking to one username instead of having one username redirect to the other to avoid potential confusion. 
support,No substantial reason to oppose. 
support,e. 
support,looks like a good user and I like his emphasis on neutrality.
support,I haven't met up with this user often but my experiences have been positive. 
support,A pleasure. 
support,YES! 
support,Strong It's that old cliche "I thought he already was one" comes to my mind. Nine months 10400+ edits and having a reasonable and civil behavior makes this user highly qualified. 
support,He has together with and others done an impressive work on [[List of purported cults]] managing to find a consensus which turned an unavoidably POV article (a list of everything at least one editor thought could be called a [[cult]]) in a wellsourced NPOV article (with clear rules for inclusion). 
support,Excellent candidate. 
support,Cool. 
support,great choice for an admin. 
support,An obvious choice. &#8212;
support,Anyone who can keep me in line while I am editing a Lyndon LaRouche page (I am a critic) deserves an adminiship. Fair calm reasonable constructive.
support,We're getting a lot of good names up here lately... keep...er...support 
support,Of course another case of "but I thought he was...". 
support,Obvious choice for admin. Unfailingly polite and thoughtful excellent grasp of policy and an eminently sensible editor. 
support,has made very sensible edits and deescalating comments on the talk page on extremely controversial and sensitive subjects such as [[list of purported cults]] [[guru]] [[cult checklist]]. (I made major contributions to the latter two articles.) 
support,Strongly support; an excellent choice indeed. Funny I was just about to nominate him myself. 
support,very happily. 
support,support: Happy to endorse Willmcw for adminship this time with one of those familiar refrains: ya mean he wasn't already? However as an aside in keeping with the spirit of the [[Brown Act]] is there yet a running tally of just how many admins there are? Wikipedia is rife with many excellent and more than competent editors to fill the bureaucratic ranks like Willmcw but someone needs to keep an eye on the balance between the number of admins and the number of posts/editors lest the bureaucracy become topheavy and vulnerable to collective [[administrative incompetence]] [[groupthink]] or worse. Hope Willmcw will support such notions. 
support,That way he can fix my stupid page moves in addition to the all the other corrections he makes to my contributions. Having Will around is like having my own personal copyeditor! 
support,Over 10000 high quality edits and a reasonable collaborator. 
support,[[Image:Flag_of_Australia.svg|15px]] 
support,Very level headed (very southernCalifornian) ;) 
support,wholeheartedly. Unfailingly calm and polite equally dedicated to Wikipedia's policies and vision. &middot; 
support,somewhat of a zealot but excellent technical knowhow. 
support,All of my interactions with him have been quite pleasant and he has often shown more patience in the face of POV pushers than I have myself been able to do. All in all I think he's a pretty reliable editor. 
support,Willmcw in my experience has been a good and conscientious contributor. 
support,The allegation below of cliquishness is obscure. That of "stalking" is at least lucid but I followed the links examined some of the claimed examples and saw nothing to worry about. 
support,I regularly check out the contributions of editors who I fear may be making bad edits that's not stalking that's diligence. 
support,Besides our obvious differences and after reading his response to my concern I have no doubt that Willmcw will be a great admin therefore my support is hereby stated. 
support,Excellent editor. 
support,I see no evidence of stalking; rather it looks like someone doing RC patrol or newpages patrol. 
support,and highly honored to do so. 
support,Seems like he'd make a very good admin. 
support,looks a great diplomat. 
support,Conditional support while I didn't neccesarily agree with him on all of the issues relating to [[CARM]] and [[Matt Slick]] he was patient with all of the annons and new users and discussed every issue brought up. He seems to be a good user. However I would like to see a response to the stalking accusations. 
support,I'm surprised he isn't one yet. I've found him great to work with and quite resourceful. 
support,Of course. 
oppose,Strongly oppose this user has engaged in personal harassment and wikistalking of me over the course of several months. (evidence is documented here <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Rangerdude#Notable_Cases> and includes over 50 separate articles and 28 distinct cases of stalking from February to June 2005) I have been informed by other editors that he behaves similarly elsewhere and believe that this behavior in general constantly violate's wikipedia's injunction to assume good faith which he often does not. His political beliefs are too strongly exhibited in his editing practices to fulfill the neutrality demanded of an administrator.
oppose,changing my vote based on apparant stalking behaviour outlined at the above RFC 
oppose,for now. I think I'd like to see the RFC dealt with before promoting this user. 
support,I had actually been thinking of nominating Woohookitty but I just nominated Spangineer. He's done a lot of impressive work in "keeping the site clean of crud" and so I think would make great use of admin powers. 
support,In my experience working with Woohookitty on the [[Wikipedia:Cleanup Taskforce|Cleanup Taskforce]] Woohookitty is an asset to Wikipedia and dedicated to making it better. &middot; 
support,Woohookitty has been volunteering for my cleanup projects since I've started them and has consistently contributed above and beyond the call of duty. Additionally I believe that Woohoo would be a fine admin and I enjoy being able to cast my support for them. 
support,Good work on redirects something a lot of users don't think to create. 
support,Very active in cleanup and thus would benefit with the admin tools. 
support,Woo hoo! 
support,Seems to relish a lot of the drudgery tasks which is always a good thing in an admin. 
support,As with is an active member of the [[Wikipedia:Cleanup Taskforce|Cleanup Taskforce]] and a pleasure to work with. 
support,Plenty of good work at cleanup. Administrator tools will be very useful. 
support,she's a dedicated janitor already 
support,impressive cleanup work strong dedication to the project. 
support,for showing dedication towards doing a lot of behindthescenes work which suits the mop and bucket perfectly. 
support,<nowiki>{{cliche}}</nowiki>

support,yeah yeah 
support,I like what I see and hear. I think you'll be an asset to Wiki.
support,Indeed. 
support,hard worker. 
support,a force for the good of Wikipedia. 
support,I've seen him/her around for oh ages generally tidying things up. 
support,Doing good work.

support,Tremendous work on [[death and state funeral of Ronald Reagan]]. 
support,and hope to see you at soon! ;) 5 July 2005 22:09 (UTC) Ooops. 
support,appears to be a good editor who would make good use of the mop and bucket. I am generally impressed with the quality and quanity of edits. 
support,you've done more in seven months than most do in 12! 
support,Likely to be an excellent admin from everything I've seen. 
oppose,Oppose. You have only been here for seven months. Any potential admin must have at least nine months of contributions before I can endorse him or her. 
support,Of course I support my own nominees! 
support,I think we should keep it real. 
support,I know this user from WP:FAC and I'm afraid I can't agree with . Worldtraveller has always diligently addressed other users' concerns about the (excellent) articles he submitted to FAC. And in case he didn't agree with objections he has always explained why. 
support,[[Cliché|He isn't one already]]? You cannot be serious. Extreme doubleplus support. 
support,I've seen great work from Worldtraveller and should have made the nomination myself. 
support,the number of featured articles he has produced speaks for itself. 
support,Definitely support great editor 
support,Worldtraveller's edits and dealings with other users look great. 
support,Seems to be quite civil in dealings with even obstreperous users. 
support,Anyone who's willing to edit in the Ashlee Simpson Empire and can do so without resorting to revert wars would seem to have what it takes to be an admin. 
support,I see lot of help with dealing with vandals thanks. 
support,Set this mop and bucket to stun. 
support,Certainly support. 
support,Definitely. 
support,Very much so. 
support,I have been trying to think of a good way to say "me too" without saying "me too". I am useless. Me too! 
support,Of course. 
support,Adminship is long overdue. 
support,one of Wikipedia's best editors his writing and scholarship are always of high quality and he is a responsive collaborator. He would make a good admin. 
support,Good dealings with this user. . 
support,Based on edits appears this editor will make good use of admin powers. 
support,No reason to believe this is anything but a good idea. 
support,Thoroughly deserving of adminship and I saw him on TV the other night! 
support,A TV star wooo! Appears to be scholarly and consensusoriented. 
support,Undoubtedly qualified. 
support,His work in the Signpost shows he knows policy and he seems fair balanced and knowledgable. 
support,Valuable and trustwrthy editor. 
support,If Worldtraveller isn't considered qualified the rest of us may as well resign right now. 
support,Very good editor. 
support,You betcha. He does great work. (How can someone be a "deletionist" when they write articles that are not only good but featured quality? That makes no sense.) 
support,an obvious one. Likely to be a superb admin. 
support,A great editor who would likely make a good admin. 
support,little doubt that he'd make a very good admin. 
support,Hello World!
support,great editor works well with others and donates lots of lovely photos as well. 
support,Looking at his edits I like him a lot better than I like myself for admin. 
support,I may be away but that won't stop me voting for these two. 
support,Of course! 
oppose,In my experience he's contentious and stubborn and also strongly deletionist. Despite weeks of effort I was unable to get him to make even the slightest concession in a longrunning content dispute. I think an admin ought to at least show some sort of willingness to compromise and not be utterly intractable. We have a few admins already who think it's either their way or the highway and I find that kind of attitude doesn't suit adminship very well. 
support,How could I nominate and not support. 
support,Solid reliable editor. 
support,I'll support excellent editor. Handles conflicts fairly evenly and with relatively cool head. 
support,I've seen a lot of highquality work from Wwoods. 
support,Switch from neutral to support. 
support,support. 
support,Positive contributions on many issues. 
support,Very observant and open to suggestions; his contributions have been very good as well 
oppose,oppose. I oppose the adminship of anyone who does not understand what the term "[[Machinereadable|machine parsable]]" means. Especially when the means to understand that term are readily available to them. This to me shows a lack of due diligence which is a primary characteristic of an administrator. 
support,Very strong support. 
support,I have seen his work and believe he would make an excellent admin. 
support,I've come to know and trust his opinion and judgement on Vfd and I feel he would be responsible and helpful. 
support,A definite. 
support,User and talk pages show us an editor who communicates well and works well with others. 
support,Seen him in VfD. 
support,Great contributor. Admins are made of such stuff. 
support,I always thought the name was some sort of play on Elizabeth. So I guess I was completely wrong. I see now [[Xezbeth|what it means]]...I hope the user doesn't take after his namesake any. 
support,Thought he was one. 
support,A fantastic contributor who works well with others I have every faith that he will be a good admin. 
support,Easy decision. 
support,An excellent user. 
support,I would love to have such stamina. 
support,Everything I have seen is quite good. 
support,he makes good edits and is very well liked 
support,not that litotes are particularly explanatory but I have no reason to oppose.

support,To me Y0u seems like a fine RC patroller who would make good use of administrator tools. 
support,Great user who would make good use of the extra tools while RC patrolling and helping users. 
support,at one period of time I see him to have the potential of being a great RC patroller. 
support,Okay; I've been convinced. Here's my support! | [[User_talk:Linuxbeak|Talk]] | 
support,RC patrol is no fun when he beats me to it. :/ 
support,Change to support. Did a little more research I liked the responses to objections and issues raised. 
support,Why haven't I supported yet? 
support,Extreme duh. 
support,Answers to questions are good and the nominator rocks .
support,I seem to remember this user from somewhere. 
support,Ooh yes please. 
support,Four edits per day is fine. We shouldn't make terminal wikiaddiction a requirement for the mop 
support,looks good to me.

support,Obvious No brainer.
support,Good editor 
support,per Rje and Haukurth.

support,I serisouly thought he was one (so cliche). 
support,Strong obviously. I thought Yelyos was one until I saw otherwise at [[WP:LA]]. [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,Weak Doesn't meet my admin criteria cause of 4 edits a day and wiki namespace a bit low for my taste but I see him editing more often and he whould benefit with the rollback button 
support,Would someone fix the vote here thing? I haven't the time. 
support,it's about damn time... 
support,Yep 
support,All my interactions with this user have been good and even though he doesn't meet certain users' editcountitis standards I feel comfortable that he'd be a good admin. 
support,Some folks just deserve it there's more than enough of a track record here to support. Good level headed editor.

support,promising user. She promises and promises... just kidding fine upstanding editor. 
support,and I've corrected everyone's spelling. 
support,Yup 
support,See no cause for concern. 
support,not only do I not see any cause for concern I also think this user will do well as an admin! 
support,Part of the furniture. Should have been adminned months ago. 
support,Notable. 
support,I found this statement from him on his talk page: "People are generally more likely to change their mind if you let them do it in their own time." That piece of wisdom alone is deserving of adminship. 
support,Of course. 
support,Great user. 
support,without hesitation. (as much as we have often disagreed). 
support,valuable contributor and organizer. 
support,Totally 
support,Ditto. 
support,If anyone thinks that we need an inclusionist for "balance" or something this is the vote. Zocky and I disagree profoundly about when and how often things should be deleted but Zocky works within policy works to actually get compromises (and not just to flood a vote) and he has never sworn that the matter is settled because he has made up his mind. He represents good writing good ethical behavior and an even temperament. I've been urging him to go RfA for ages and would have nominated him had I known he would agree.

support,Wow first time I get to exercise my democratic Wiki right and vote for someone whose work I am admittedly not very familiar with but I'm familiar with him on other nonWiki projects.

support,I of course support myself in this selfnomination for Adminship. 16:53 16 December 2005 (UTC) Removed per Linuxbeak. 
oppose,250 edit?! See the unofficial standards for adminship. I'm sure you'll be great one day but more experience is needed. 
oppose,I'm sorry; you're obviously well meaning and you have had an account for several months now. However you have only recently started heavily editing and as of this vote you only had around 80 mainspace edits. I'm not one for editcounting but you have not been active enough to be able to make informed administrator decisions. Come back when you have some more editing and community experience. Also as a sidenote: selfnoms do not get a "nominators vote". 
oppose,for now. From what we have to work with you seem competent and all that. But the reason for wanting some level of edit count is so that we have a large sample of your work. Come back in a few months and I'd be happy to support. (
oppose,Slightly editcountitis and my only brush with the user was a premature CSD (in my opinion) on an article by an experienced editor <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Andrew_Rollings_and_Ernest_Adams_on_Game_Design>. 
oppose,Opppose for now more experience is needed for consideration. 
oppose,Far far far too early to tell candidate's fitness. 
oppose,While goodintentioned this has very little likelihood of passing. Further pileoners will be shot on site. I urge demon to withdraw this nom. 
oppose,Not being a pileon as freedback to the candidate should always be helpful. It appears that you do not have enough experience across the areas of wikipedia to be ready yet (e.g. categories templates projects). A good way to get more experience would be to join a WikiProject to work on something. 
oppose,highly suggest candidate withdraws. 
oppose,demon is an ok user but try reappling in about 23 months. Try to get you edit count up and keep on making good contributions and I will support one day. 
support,obviously as the nominator of Ævar. 
support,If someone has direct access to the database it means that we have already placed more trust in him than we place in admins. I don't see why he can't be trusted with tools much less powerful than the ones he already has. As for the image deletion problem everyone is allowed to have a bad day. 
support,Great guy. [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,Argh...titoxd took the words right out of my mouth!!!!!!! (add about 15 more exclaimation marks ;)). Anyways... 
support,Ævar has been persistently helpful whenever I've encountered him the old imagedeletion thing appears done and dusted (and I thought he'd been readminned afterwards... hmm.) and I'm sure he's sensible enough to discuss anything similar in future after what happened last time. (Would be happier supporting if he didn't transclude his .sig though) 
support,[[soup|]] My extremely high standards are less now before this user would of had to have like 5000 edits but close enough anyway. And edit counts don't really matter just seems like a good user so I support. Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by 
support,Yeh. The image thing was a long time ago and as someone else says everyone has a bad day... but (wags finger) don't do it again! 
support,the issue which led to his desysopping was grossly overblown and Ævar remains thoroughly trustworthy. 
support,per . 
support,Thanks for all the hard work on the development side (in addition to your en:wiki work). 
support,Contributors from small countries need a lot more representation and I've seen enough of Ævar to know that he's definitely adminship material. 
support,I've known AEB for a long time. 
support,This is the first case where the RfA cliché #1 is actually true. 
support,Forgive and forget 
support,There clearly are issues and Ævar needs to be clear on which hat he's wearing at any one time. Given that he's prepared to keep that in mind let's try again. 
support,S'port see comment section. 
support,[[WP:ESP|e]]
support,I am concerned about the selfsysopping but I'm sure it was done in good faith. 
support,I think a second chance is reasonable here. 
support,No reason to deny the mop and broom to a developer. 
support,those comments about sysoping himself and mass deleting images are silly. Yub plain silly. However the prick deserved deopping because he himself is silly. Of course that is a silly argument and the sillyness of this is far to great for me to comprehend. So by all means give him sysop status. 
support,Strong I am feel bad that I am opposing the votes of such heavyweights. For example such as Kate who created Kate's tool and offers solid logic but anyone is entitled to a few mistakes (and his actions may not have been inappropriate?? his explanations seem reasonable). Additionally a person who has developer privileges is trusted to a higher level than is an admin. Editors are making too much of a "big deal" out of these details I think: Denying Ævar admin status would be like telling a general that he doesn't have basic security clearance to be on base. Obviously a general does have earned trust to do the most basic of things exposing this logic as flawed. Therefore I strongly support.
support,I know Ævar as reasonable and willing to help person. 
support,Trustworthy on the whole unlikely to repeat past actions and others have already pointed out the incongruity of a developer not having admin status. 
support,A developer without admin rights is well wrong. 
support,Still hot. 
support,Oops bugger. Your admin bit should have been switched straight back on IMO 
support,let's not be churlish about this 
support,Good friendly user who deserves adminship. 
support,sometimes a bit too quick on the draw but i'd trust him to look out for the best interests of wiki. 
support,proved himself reliable in good faith with his development work was outoftouch and didn't know how Wikipedia was supposed to work now he does. 
support,this user deserves a second chance. 
oppose,Per my comments above and below. I couldn't find a document saying what devs should and shouldn't do I suppose it lurks in devdom somewhere. But Kate said it above. I'm deeply unhappy that you sysopped yourself today for no good reason in a completely nonemergency situation. It feels like having realised that being an admin is fun thought you'd do the process retrospectively. That doesn't show the good judgement I'd like I'm afraid. And there seems to be a little bit of immodesty too in your comment below although you wouldn't be the only admin with that problem. (Minor point but devs of all people shouldn't be transcluding signatures.) 
oppose,From what I've seen of Ævar he is a great developer but I feel I must agree with Splash. The sysopping thing really bothered me especially since you said that you couldn't wait for an admin to do it. That doesn't make any sense to me you could just have contacted any one admin who was active at the time and had them do it. It wouldn't have taken long and sysopping yourself is just way out of line. Also I'm afraid the image deletion is just way to much for me to be able to support (and it wasn't that long ago it was in may for crying out loud). You don't need to be an admin to contribute either content or code 
oppose,My impression of Avar is that he often acts on impulse without considering the consequences of his actions which is not a desirable trait in an administrator. Regardless of his motives for these image deletions he did (as I understand it) delete several images which were being used in articles creating a significant amount of work for other people who had to restore these images from archives or find replacements. His mass deletion of anon talk pages seems somewhat strange; I could understand a proposal to delete or perhaps blank old anonymous users' talk pages but wholesale deletion of them seems somewhat excessiveparticularly since Avar only touched pages which he himself had edited. Furthermore I felt Avar's block of 
oppose,I found all the business leading up to desysopping to be uncomfortably mysterious and inexplicable despite attempted explanations. 
oppose,for the excellent reasons cited above (the mass deletion of images the mass deletion of anonymous users' talk pages the deletion of his own talk page the selfsysopping and the overall pattern of poor judgement). I see no reason why someone with such a spotty record should be trusted to effectively function as an admin (which as Kate noted is not comparable to being a developer). 
oppose,Aevar has abused his position and should not be honored for it. 
oppose,The above users make good points and I echo them with one addition. I believe that deleting one's own user talk page seriously undermines the transparency of the Wikipedia process. You could simply blank it and "purge" it into the page history. With adminship one is often dealing with users who do not understand the entire Wikipedia process due to their newness stubbornness intent to vandalize etc. In answer to the image questions you say that you'll go through the proper channels before deletion. But Ævar has shown to us quite recently by temporarily resysopping himself that he does not intend to constantly follow procedure. Actions speak louder than words and while I respect his contributions on the Mediawiki and Icelandic side of things but I'm afraid that his trustworthiness on en is yet to be determined by his actions. 
oppose,Reluctantly oppose. He has many good contributions and I don't want to discourage him but I also must weigh the comments above and below showing this might be a bit hasty. Most specifically recently using developer powers to delete his user pages including all history. This has since been restored but that action troubles me enough to oppose this nomination at this time. 
oppose,the above users make good points. In addition you haven't answered my question completely. If you deleted your user and talk pages to "archive" them why didn't you explain so at the time? Why are telling that to us now? In addition you haven't clarified exactly why you deleted your comments from IP address talk pages. You write "Furthermore I removed some old welcome messages of mine to anonymous like [[User talk:61.240.135.180|Nice work on William Farr School You might want to create an account to get all the benefits of registered users]] and [[User talk:66.248.2.54|Quite impressive work on Rudy LaRusso you might want to create an account to get all the benefits of a logged in user.]] as well as old ban messages like [[User talk:66.144.4.4|You are blocked for the next 24hrs for repeted vandalism on Richard Stallman]]." Why? While I think you do excellent work as a developer I don't think that you are ready for readminship by the community yet. | [[User talk:Flcelloguy|A note? ]]</font color>| 
oppose,When I tried to <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Human_feces&diff=20515480&oldid=20279678 compromise> on a controversial edit Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Human_feces&diff=next&oldid=20515568 spurned> my attempt at compromise. This is not the kind of behavior I expect from someone who is going to be an admin. 
oppose,After being neutral for a while (see my comments in that section) I've decided to change my vote to oppose. There's no single item that bothers me enough to do this but the combination of things all adds up to a pattern in my mind of I'm above the rules. I'm willing to say the image removal was all just an honest mistake and the resysoping was probably completely harmless and done in good faith. I still don't understand why he removed stuff from other user's talk pages but there's probably no major harm done there. The one that really gets me is deleting his own talk page. Again by itself that probably wouldn't have convinced me but it all adds up to a bad pattern. 
oppose,Pretty much per Kate's response to 's vote. Adminship should be granted to anyone trustworthy and developing and being an En admin are different. Actively giving reasons not to deserve that trust as has been done shouldn't be rewarded with adminship. Please keep up the development work but giving yourself admin powers when not needed is over the top. 
oppose,It might be a language barrier: I don't understand his mixture of Icelandic and English in his responses and I'm not sure he understands peoples' concerns above when he responds to questions about deleting his pages by saying he "achived" them. It contributes to his difficulty on this Wikipedia I think. 
oppose,for a number of reasons noted above. A developer is not a superset of an admin or vice versa. He might make a fantastic developer yet not be a good admin or vice versa. Exhibited behavior both here on this RfA and elsewhere is not encouraging. 
oppose,The three problematic actions taken together indicate that unfortunately the user should not be an admin. 
oppose,<! Extreme Lesbian >Oppose. Developer ~>= Admin. Once promoted I'm constantly trying to get them to [[WP:IAR]] but this history of behavior seems above and beyond even my fairly loose admin standards. 
oppose,Oppose reasons stated by others. 
oppose,The opposition is persuasive. 
oppose,reluctantly. I like Ævar as a person but he seems to be prone to acting rashly at times. 
oppose,per Samboy. 
oppose,not enough quality edits (as I said once before). 
oppose,I agree with most of the opposition reasons above. I believe that a pattern of poor administrative decisions has been shown. 
oppose,Someone who thinks that deleting a talk page is a valid way of 'archiving' it should not have access to a delete button. 
oppose,for all the reasons above but mainly his selfresysopping. 
oppose,For the most part I'm totally baffled by what happened with his desysoping even after reading through the old logs but I'd want to see evidence of good behavior in the recent past. Resysopping himself is definitely not a good sign of that. Given his disregard for other processes in the past and GDFL concerns with images I would expect more caution from him. I'd recommend that he reapply after a few months of good behavior. 
oppose,I'm especially concerned about the talkpage thing; the dubious precedent of deletion of talk page comments is getting to be pretty wellestablished: the use of admin or indeed developer privs to do so really ought to be very strongly discouraged. 
oppose,per Splash. This action really bothered me I try to review all the actions of a RfA candidate and rarely vote oppose. Being a developer is a serious responsibility if we can't trust that one won't give permissions w/o prior approval then I definately can't trust them as a sysop. Even though sysops have little power it's not a power to be abused there is always an alternative. [[Special:Contributions/Who|∞]]

My user name is in Cyrillic but my signature is in Roman alphabet. And I'm with English Wikipedia since July.
oppose,for above reasons. 
oppose,per above.May the Force be with you! 
oppose,I'm sure Djordje (I can't type his name in native letters) is a great guy and a good admin at the Serbian Wikipedia but that doesn't mean he has to be an admin here too. His talk page shows very little interaction and his contributions show a very narrow area of interest. I don't think he needs AdministrativePower® just to add information and correct mistakes in Serbiarelated articles. 
oppose,agree with JIP. 
oppose,The person is simply unknown to en: community to make a fair judgement. Nothing personal sorry simply too early. 
oppose,as per jkelly JIP and Kelly Martin's comments. 
oppose,per JIP. 
support,Very Strong I know Bogdangiusca and I trust him. His huge contributions proves a very decent calm and friendly attitude. He is a man that won't make compromise to lies. He is by far the best of us and he was always our model. 
support,Very Strong I thought he was already an admin. If not that's strange. He's the best Romanian contributor on Wiki. 
support,Very Strong One of the few times I don't even have to wait to hear how the candidate answers the questions. Probably our single best contributor on Romanianrelated topics and a veritable rolemodel in terms of his behavior. 
support,Very Strong The candidate knows his domain of competency really well and is one of the Romanian contributors without a hidden agenda. 
support,given that he accepts the nomination. 
oppose,He appears not to be interested. 
support,too many vandals not enough admins. Why not? 
oppose,lack of experience with policy and process. 
oppose,Lack of wiki namespace edits. 
oppose,Does not meet my experience criterias regarding User Talk Categories Wikipedia. 
oppose,As stated above I don't think this user has enough experience. As an admin you need to have come across all kinds of things in the past so you know what the policy is to deal with it. 
oppose,Only 615 edits in total and only 400 in the Article namespace. User needs more experience. 
oppose,I suggest the candidate withdraws and reapplies when his editcount is around 2000. 
support,As nominator of course. 
support,Extreme DeCSS support of course! I have seen this user around a lot. 
support,A clever diligent editor 
support,I've seen a lot of ALTTP. 
support,Strong is [[WP:RFA|dedicated]] to improving the quality of the encyclopedia. A few people would do well to remember what our goal is here. 
oppose,Too few edit summaries. 
oppose,The discussion on [[Talk:Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back]] really disturbes me. I believe that comments such as the one A man in black cites (<http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AStar_Wars_Episode_V%3A_The_Empire_Strikes_Back&diff=24683943&oldid=24616426>) and others on that page (such as <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Star_Wars_Episode_V:_The_Empire_Strikes_Back&diff=next&oldid=24705060> and <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Star_Wars_Episode_V:_The_Empire_Strikes_Back&diff=next&oldid=24706217>) is unacceptable for any wikipedian let alone an administrator. And yes I realise that the discussion was frustrating but an admin needs patience in boatloads enough to be able to handle these things. However from what else I have seen of A Link To The Past he seems like a very good user and I am willing to change my vote in a few months if this RfA fails (barring any similar incidents naturally). 
oppose,An excellent editor but a little too rash to be an admin at this point. Needs to have his edges dulled a bit. For example this quote from August 25 regarding [[User_talk:Adamwankenobi|Adamwankenobi]]: I also see you're sixteen years old. That would explain it. Oh well at least school will help keep you from burdening Wikipedia anymore. I'm trying to help Empire Strikes Back and you put that shit back on. I have encouraged admins at the wikipedia channel to not take vandal shit from you so I suggest you fix up your act or your ass is going to be torn. Admittedly Adamwankenobi was a bad faith user but admins must keep their cool. Regrettably I must oppose at this point. Sorry! 
oppose,per Andre. Needs to keep a cooler head. 
oppose,Following some of these links there's just no way.So yeah blow me. I don't want to change it so what? Are you gonna have a fucking heart attack over it? This is just Wikipedia. Just two days ago. 
oppose,Lacks the patience and temperment to be an admin. 
oppose,per above. 
oppose,I'm sorry ALTTP. Though he's generally a great editor and I'm always on his side in disputes he's far too rash and prone to getting into heated arguments and revert wars (some of which have led to pages being protected). He's a great editor (I love the [[Wario]] and [[Lakitu]] articles)... but I don't think he would make a good admin especially when dealing with . 
oppose,his recent outbursts of temper are just way to recent to be ignored. And for an 18 year old to mock a 16 year old for his youth well that's just the pot calling the kettle black. 
oppose,[[Opera|Oppose]] seems too angry to be an admin. I don't believe he'll make a good one I oppose. 
oppose,Needs to keep a cool head more. 
oppose,An admin must be polite and calm at all times. 
oppose,per GregAsche. 
oppose,excellent editor tireless contributor and allaround good bloke. However darnit needs to pay a lot more attention to being patient civil and avoiding personal attacks. Promising to clean up one's act is all very well but I don't think anyone should be up for adminship just four days after swearing at another user? It's not enough to make good edits; an admin should be cool under fire. 
oppose,per above. 
oppose,too hot headed from my experience. 
support,Believe Aaron would not abuse admin tools. 
support,Arguing less and being more circumspect would be a good idea but he's not over the line now so objections to him I feel are somewhat overblown. 
support,Obviously. One of the people with the clearest idea of what Wikipedia should be. 
oppose,Strongly Oppose. In my opinion Aaron is wholly unsuitable to be an admin. He has a long list of uncivil behavior culminating most recently with outright rulebreaking and vandalism <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/IgnoreAllRules>. I recognize that he has apologized for his vandalism but the very fact that he committed this egregious offense in the first place is a clear demonstration that he lacks the maturity to act responsibly if given additional powers at WP. Aaron's use of the racial epithet "nigger" and the phrase "...even they call each other that..." (presumably "they" in this context is in reference to the "niggers" in question) in an AfD debate <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Bartlett_High_School%2C_Bartlett%2C_Illinois> demonstrates a horrible display of racial insensitivity at the least and arguably racism at the worst even though his subsequent claim was that this racist term was used to prove a point. I do not think that tossing racial epithets about in the course of AfD debates is appropriate behavior for an admin. He frequently assumes bad faith and shows little if any regard for [[WP:AGF]] there really are countless examples of his assuming bad faith <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Tony_Sidaway/Archive_2005_09_18#List_of_female_porn_stars>. His chronic bloodthirstiness to see 's adminship removed <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Tony_Sidaway#Pull_your_thumb_out> (and other places) borders on inexcusable. These and other innapropriate behaviors and comments are really far too many to document in the context of this vote. It should also be mentioned that these incidents are recent occurrences not some ancient buried offenses way way back in this editor's history. These are only a few egregious actions within the last 23 months. Thinking that he was already an admin is no reason to nominate him. I fear for Aaron's future victims if he is awarded special admin powers.
oppose,The [[Special:Contributions/IgnoreAllRules|sockpuppet incident]] that Radiant! mentions is very recent (October 18th barely two weeks ago) was an intentional disruption of Wikipedia in a badly misguided attempt to make a point and exhibited a serious lack of judgment on his part. I cannot in good faith support him at this time. Oppose. 
oppose,Use of sockpuppet abusive behavior and vandalism all very recent events. I think this user has some good intentions but being an administrator would not be an appropriate role for him. 
oppose,Oppose. As per Kelly and Durin. Would like to see more evidence of ability to handle disputes without losing his temper and it's too soon after the sockpuppet incident. 
oppose,but weakly...behave yourself for 90 days and then I will change my vote to support in all liklihood.
oppose,Oppose for now: the sockpuppetry has me worried and Aaron is a bit controversial. He's a good editor though and I would support in the future. 
oppose,per Mervoingian. 
oppose,Although I am gladdened to see that has apologized for the sockpuppet incident that it happened at all must push me to oppose. 
oppose,as he did vandalism in the past. 
oppose,Oppose per and to some degree who has worded his comment far more strongly than I would have. The comments of are a worthy counterpoint to some of Nicodemus75's comment. (I will no longer use a bold font for my oppose votes no matter how strongly I feel because it seems like it has the potential to be unnecessarily insulting to the candidate and because I hope my comments are more important that the generalized summary of them in the form of a vote) 
oppose,Oppose all of the above
oppose,Strong Oppose per the fact that I hate Sockpuppetry and the tone of the response made on the afd mentioned were completely unacceptable for an admin regardless of how you feel about the words "Deletionist" or "Inclusionist"(I agree with on that argument by the way and have a similiar view with editcountitis). 
oppose,per above comments. 
oppose,polarisation among admins has always at minimum resulted in unnecesary stress. User seems to have problems with until this and any other dispute have been resolved its inaproporate at this point. Also if the "vandalsim" accusations are acurate I would me most certainly less than inclined to hand delete powers. 
support,I trust that ABCD will not abuse his admin powers and a penchant for grunt work (not to be confused with work) is always useful. 
support,I'll support based on contributions. I would like to see more edit summaries though. 
support,I'm assuming good faith. 
oppose,No substantive edits and too early in any case. 
oppose,To me 2.5 months is good enough. But however I have to agree with Brockert: ABCD rarely leaves edit summaries. If you want to come back PLEASE start leaving edit summaries. Thank you. 
oppose,Get more involved. 
oppose,Since you haven't left edit summaries before January 15 2005 it is hard for us to know about the nature of your work. Also I would like to see more interaction with other users. Come back after a few months and I will support you. 
oppose,Oppose though likely to support in the future with more experience good edits and preferably more content creation. Also please consistently use useful edit summaries. 
oppose,Too new I suspect this account is not their only one. First edit was a <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Preliminary_Deletion/Vote&diff=prev&oldid=7042939 vote on Nov 1> rest of their edits are just runs of grunt work likely done to increase edit count quickly and move towards adminship. I'd consider changing my mind if I'm proven wrong in this interpretation. 
oppose,Too new. Oppose. 
support,We need more janitors. 
support,I've supported ABCD in Januari and still do. 
support,Just like last time. 
support,Good faith though I would have preferred that ABCD wait to be nominated by someone else rather than selfnom again. 
support,I was thinking of nominating this user in April. There is absolutely no evidence of sockpuppetry. Good janitor. 
support,for his janitorial work. Will do better with a mop and bucket. 
support,Sure 
support,Janitorial work is needed in Wikipedia. I'm sure this person will need adminsip to help him or her with such work. 
support,I believe I opposed last time because of not enough edit summaries and I have seen this ameliorate. By the way ABCD is not a sockpuppet of me and I am not a sockpuppet of ABCD</big></big>. 
support,This whole "sockpuppet" thing seems rather silly. 
support,He is a good janitor. I have seen no evidence for him being a sockpuppet merely Netoholic's hearsay and I do not find his wanting to be an admin overly excessive. 
support,support. good user the only issue seem to be sockpuppet concerns. assume some good faith people! I don't know the Alex case but you can't hold it against Jonathan that he uses the same ISP! Jonathan showed good faith by disclosing his name and location. He stated that he is not Alex (and this vote is obviously based on the statement. Should it turn out that he is after all Alex it will be arbcom time. But I don't expect that to happen). Thank you for your useful work ABCD and thanks for sticking around after your previous request was turned down. I do think people with a penchant for cleanup rather than articlewriting are perfect admin material (myself I spend too much time editing articles to be much use as a janitor) 
support,The only problem seems to be the sockpuppet issue and I don't think he is. 
support,I see evidence only of positive motives by this editor for wanting adminship to further abilities to contribute to Wikipedia. 
support,I have seen his work on VfD and consider he deserves to be an admin. 
support,switching stratagems takes some guts. Alright fine by me Note however that I'll keep an eye on ABCD. 
oppose,I'm going to go with oppose sorry. Overeagerness to become an admin isn't bad in and of itself but doesn't lend extra confidence either. The note on your talk page re: archiving people's comments is a bit immature in addition. If you want to be an admin should you model yourself after one that is under constant controversy or those that more or less are not? (Not necessarily pointing to myself here. I'll consider moving to at least Neutral if the preponderance of the evidence is that all of your edits are in good faith and there haven't been any obvious transgressions but I don't have time to look through all the diff's right now. But overall no offense keep up the good work just not sure you need admin powers just yet. 
oppose,Oppose as before. Previous vote at [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/ABCD.09]] (moved there by ABCD not sure why). I remain convinced this is a new account of the person known as >////>/. Also I don't like that he's selfnominated again and also tried <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3AContributions&target=ABCD&hideminor=0&namespace=3 soliciting votes>. 
oppose,I must oppose yet again. I am very uncomfortable with the vote solicitation and I have sockpuppet concerns. 
oppose,Oppose I don't think that's enough time editing really. I am also a bit concerned about overeagerness. 
oppose,Not enough time editing. 
oppose,Does not meet my . This is an encyclopaedia not a social club 
oppose,. If there is actual evidence that he's a sockpuppet take it to the ArbCom. The fact that ABCD lives within 100 miles of another user is not convincing. He's enthusiastic and wants to help with cleanup tasks. That's good enough for me. 
support,1337ness!!! [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,Extreme lesbian support 
support,Despite the dispute we had on my RfB or perhaps because of it I feel I can confidently support Acetic Acid. Good luck. 
support,My watchlist tells me he's very in the community and policy related pages. 
support,Hmm thought you were one. 
oppose,Strong Oppose. While he is a notable candidate he has only been here since July 23. That according to the standards that others have been judged on is much much too short. Secondly only about 200 edits in article namespace; his edits count is high mainly because he welcomes others; no sysop powers are needed for that. All in all he still needs about a month more experience. </sup/><p style="fontfamily: Bradley Hand ITC Comic Sans MS;">
oppose,A good dude but not enough article edits. 
oppose,A month and a half isn't enough experience even if you have ten thousand edits. 
oppose,like the others said not enough experience. Acetic Acid please answer the candidate questions below. 
support,Although new account he has done good job cleaning up. No Vandalisim. Had one copyright issue but cleaned it up after complaint about it. good job! 
oppose,Should have created a User account earlier. Give it a few months. I also dislike the incorrect capitalisation of 'i'. 
oppose,Way too new less than 125 edits and only a few days old his account. Try again in 3 months sorry. 
oppose,Looking at your edits just from this evening I have considerable difficulty believing you've been around for two years as an editor. Come back in a few months. 
oppose,Please review [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Standards|unofficial standards]] and reapply in 23 months. 04:49 11 December 2005 (UTC) User is clearly not even close to being ready for adminship 
oppose,Did you only create an account to get up for RfA? 
oppose,Writes copyvios and tries to hide them up. 
oppose,per above. 
oppose,Strong Oppose Account is not "fairly new" but utterly new. Edits such as <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=True_Crime%3A_NYC&diff=30798032&oldid=30790207> and <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Jody_Thompson&oldid=30880287> are written in the first person contain vast amounts of misspelling and grammical errors do not follow Wikipedia style do not use sections and are written in the perspective of game guides as opposed to encyclopedic content. Therefore user's claim of 2 years of editing experience is highly doubtful and user cannot be trusted currently with admin responsibilities. 
oppose,and suggest delisting. Three days on Wikipedia is clearly not enough experience for adminship. 
oppose,per Znode's research. Delisting would probably be a good idea. 
oppose,This candidate might be doing a good job at removing vandalism but I doubt he is ready enough for administrator powers. Try again in several months (not [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Adam1213/old|in one week]]). 
oppose,. I hate to come off the bat with this but I feel like not enough time has passed since your last RfA which is listed below. I think the more appropriate choice would have been to create a new RfA page but link to this one. Either way I think it's still too soon. [[User_talk:Evilphoenix|Burn!]] 06:15 14 October 2005 (UTC) <br>Strong Oppose. User blanked my oppose vote the first time I posted it amongst refactoring this page: <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Adam1213&diff=next&oldid=25489011>. User has also been engaging in asking for support on IRC which I object to. 
oppose,Strong Oppose My interaction with this user (realtime on irc) has shown me that he's a little bit immature. His reaction style can also be seen at 
oppose,I don't think that Adam1213 has shown the understanding of Wikipedia policies and practice needed to be an admin. Fighting vandalism is commendable but it isn't a good way to pick Administrators. 
support,No good reason to oppose. 
oppose,1000 edits overall less than 500 to article namespace. In my opinion not yet experienced enough to be an administrator. Sorry. 
oppose,Good start but more experience is needed. 
oppose,Oppose. Maybe later. 
oppose,until you format the description properly. 
oppose,made a comment in the [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Alleged causes of Hurricane Katrina|AfD for Alleged causes of Hurricane Katrina]] that leads me to question his understanding of the AfD process a key aspect of Wikipedia for any administrator to fully understand. Specifically he wrote "For keeping we have 27. For deleating we have 32. Sorry keepers you're so far outweighed." This seems to imply that he thought a simple majority vote constitutes consensus to delete. Please note that this vote is not based on any feelings I might have about that Afd I have voted to support many admin candidates who have cast AfD/VfD votes against me (including at least one who I voted for shortly after he had voted to delete in this very same AfD). 
oppose,Couldn't manage to set up his selfnom correctly a bad sign for someone who would like to be an admin. A bit more experience in the "Ways of the Wiki" is required. 
oppose,Lack of [[edit summary|edit summaries]]. Also use the preview button a bit more often. 
oppose,shows inexperience in that he hasnt set up his nomination conventionally nor has he accepted his own nomination. Also the "one sentence" answers to the questions doesn't show that much thought was put into them. A good editor nevertheless. </sup/><p style="fontfamily: Bradley Hand ITC Comic Sans MS;">
oppose,You're off to a good start but you only have 1000 edits and a quarter of those are at User pages. I am close to support but you need more edits and next time give better answers to the questions and format your request properly. 
oppose,Oppose;'. Notice how he says he would ban or block users? Admins should know that we can't unilatterly ban someone</big>. We need ArbCom or Jimbo... An admin should at least know the meaning of 'ban' in my opinion... [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
oppose,Weak oppose. A good editor and contributor but a bit too little experience. Also agree with BD2412 Journalist and Redwolf24. 
oppose,I have to be honest I had had no real dealings with the User but when I went to his User page the cartoon there offends me. 
oppose,[[User talk:AfC#Blocked for image vandalism|Recent vandalism]] and <http://kohl.wikimedia.org/~kate/cgibin/count_edits?user=AfC&dbname=enwiki 159 edits>. I've asked the user to withdraw the nomination for now. 
oppose,Image vandal; not anything like enough edits to have become familiar with WP policies; and does not answer the questions to admin candidates properly. I have to say I think it may be a bad faith nomination. 
oppose,Far too early! See my comment below but AfC doesn't have enough experience and this likely a joke nomination look at his answer to the questions below. 
oppose,not enough experience no serious answers to questions for candidate vandalism possibly sock puppet. 
oppose,Way too early and the other comments are worrying me. | [[User_talk:Linuxbeak|Talk]] | 
oppose,Why waste more words? 
oppose,Strong Oppose Joke or not user ripped off an Eisenhower speech when answering below and that alone is behaviour unbefitting an admin. The image vandalism and very low edit count provide even more reason. 
oppose,No. 
oppose,Absolutely Not Words and actions on this RfA alone show that the candidate is not nearly ready for the position and responsiblities that go with it. 
oppose,Not only is the edit count low (and always forgetting to sign in is not a good mark of an admin either) but the various responses and contributions of this user lead me to believe that this user would not make a good admin and I wonder if this is a joke nomination as well. 
oppose,Hurrr. I'm disappointed in those of you saying you WONDER if it's a joke nom. Assume bad faith sometimes sheesh. 
oppose,I'm sorry but with 331 edits no discrtiption of yourself and still finding your way around you are too new for the mop. Try again in a few months. You seen to be doing ok. 
oppose,Wait 2 months and 1000 more edits 
oppose,Not to start a clobbering parad but yeah too soon no description and you don't need to be an admin to edit soccer pages. 
oppose,Sorry but you don't have enough edits or experience to be an admin here. I'd recommend waiting till 1000 edits (2000 is safer) and waiting for another editor to nominate you (since people who have nominated themselves more than once [[Wikipedia:Unsuccessful_adminship_candidacies|haven't usually been very successful]]). 
oppose,The numerous spelling mistakes in answering his questions here suggest an amount of sloppiness that is inappropriate for an admin.

oppose,I wasn't going to vote as there was no need but those diffs from mean I must vote so that I can condemn vandalism and suggest a very long wait before trying again. 
oppose,Strong Oppose. User also just called us all bullies and left Wikipedia. "Blah". 
support,over 400 edits in the Wikipedia namespace is quite enough and you seem to be familiar with policy. I like your answers to the questions below and I don't see any reason why you shouldn't be an admin. One and a half months of heavy editing is enough by my standards. Just remember to use edit summaries consistently and you'll be a fine admin. 
oppose,Needs more experience. First edit was only about 7 weeks ago. Looks to be a good start though. 
oppose,per Carbonite. Will support in two more months. One suggestion for the future please use edit summaries more frequently. It helps the RC Patrollers out a lot. [[User Talk:Acetic Acid|Acetic]]
oppose,Will support in one month. 
oppose,So far your edits look good but you need to spend some more time here. A couple of months later (barring anything catastropic) the vote will probably be changed.

support,All round good guy and an asset to Wikipedia. 
support,Meets my (though unfortunately it seems doing lots of minor edits is more important if you want to become an admin rather than writing good quality articles) 
support,Strong Alkivar is one great guy. →
oppose,Sorry but I don't think someone who calls people who disagree with him "morons" in an edit summary <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Niger_Innis&diff=11314263&oldid=11314171> will make a good administrator. Perhaps in time (that edit is only three days old) but I can't support currently. 
oppose,Oppose user has in past added falsified data <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=BeOS&diff=9894789&oldid=9886309> backed up with unprovable statements has removed discussions (although this got a bit heated as you'll see from this edit) from his talk page about this information <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Alkivar&diff=9909096&oldid=9900400> and has at other times messed with other users user pages <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Alkivar&diff=10533406&oldid=10533370>. Doesn't seem suitable for an admin for much the same reasons I'll never be suitable. 
oppose,Strong oppose. Does not believe in Wikiquette. 
oppose,Strong oppose mainly based on repeated runins on VfD that did not display the maturity I expect out of an admin although there are other reasons as well (obviously). 
oppose,I think Alkivar is a very good editor but unfortunately has a tendency to make personal attacks. Sorry. 
oppose,Reluctantly oppose. Good editor but bad "people skills". 
oppose,On the basis of above comments and the grammar and spelling of the acceptance Oppose. 
oppose,For the most part Alkivar is a great editor unfortunatly he has displayed poor people skills. I will support in the future if he shows more civility in conflict. 
oppose,Oppose. Seems to get hot under the collar rather too easily. 
oppose,Hesitant oppose. Excellent editor and very active in community stuff (such as VfD) but he does tend to have a somewhat short fuse. Will support in the future if this problem is dealt with. 
oppose,I've seen him get pretty worked up on VfDs that he disagreed with and insult the nominators. Seems like a good guy otherwise if he calms down a bit maybe I'll support. 
oppose,user can get pretty rude to those he disagrees with. That's not exactly an endearing trait for an editor and a nightmare as an admin. 
oppose,I don't know Alkivar but judging by his interrogation of the people opposing him here I am not entirely confident that he would be a levelheaded admin. If you want to prove me wrong Alkivar I'm happy to be disproven. 
oppose,I'm voting against because of Alkivar's response to 's oppose vote (Pardon the seemingly rude question but who are you exactly? I have NEVER seen your sig before today) and his response when I queried it (I even asked in the nicest way possible ... If this is to be construed as rude and abrupt well then I guess I just dont <sic> know what a civilized conversation is) when even a glance at Kelly's contributions show she's a legitimate editor. This is exactly the kind of aggression an admin should not display. I'll vote for Alkivar in a couple of months or so if he can show he's taken steps to go a little easier on people. 
oppose,Reluctantly . I've had brief but positive experiences in the past with Alkivar. However he's demonstrably too hotheaded to be an admin. That said not everyone needs to be an admin to be a valuable contributor to Wikipedia and Alkivar is an excellent editor. 
oppose,based on a review of many exchanges with other editors. I endorse what the voter directly above said. 
oppose,per recent personal attack on VfD page in spite of his promises below. 
oppose,Definitely he's done some good work but I've had enough poor experience in dealing with him that I have to oppose for now. 
oppose,Alkivar's done some great work for Wikipedia but administrators should deal with others with more civility. His comments on this page alone especially with respect to Kelly Martin (and also to Radiant) are enough to push me to oppose. I'd definitely support in the future if he can slightly modify the way he interacts with users he disagrees with. 
support,Alkivar is awesome. 
support,great guy. 
support,Certainly. 
support,We've had our differences but since he's been willing to put them behind us I will happily do the same. 
support,Strong I've had nothing but good communications with Alkivar. 
support,We've had our disagreements but over time my opinion of Alkivar has improved. 
support,Hey! I'd already told Alkivar I was gonna nominate him at the end of the month (i.e. tomorrow!) no fair! (Oh and support BTW) 
support,Nicer than most admins I have ran into. 
support,Alkivar has improved since last nomination. 
support,Seems like a good user. 
support,UM YES!" :D 
support,Very helpful user. 
support,good and hardworking user. Not a great diplomat but I believe he has learned a lot from the conflicts he's been in and will be a better admin for them. 
support,I think we should keep it real. I belive that Alkivar will be a good admin despite of being controversial user. 
support,Based upon this user's edit summary it appears that he would be an excellent addition to the staff. My earlier question about the nominator seems moot in light of the fact that Grutness a wellknown contributor was eagerly looking forward to nominating Alkivar for adminship anyhow. 
support,Hardworking and plays well with others. 
support,Three months overdue. 
support,Of course. The oppose votes are wholly baseless. 
support,I see respectable people voting for and nothing problematic in edits. You should make edit summary for every contribution to save time of people on RC patrol (hence the weak). 
support,Absolutely support if you don't support you just haven't made an effort to research him. I don't care who nominated him I'd nominate him myself. He sent me (a total stranger) at his own expense and carefully packaged a whole bunch of material from NASA that's becoming the <http://wikisource.org/w/index.php?title=NASA_Facts NASA Facts collection on wikisource> what's there at present is barely the tip of the iceberg (the stack is about 2 inches thick of reports lovingly hoarded for just such a purpose) the delay is my fault I don't have that much time that I can use the scanner because I have to borrow it. Anyway he contributes well and makes good edits and is genuinely concerned with keeping wikipedia a great thing and has done a lot of work and seems to me will be a good admin. see my comment on bite me below. And ask yourself how many articles you have shepherded to FA status Alkivar has several. 
support,Good edits strong contributions appears to understand policy. 
support,Changed my mind I was far too quick to pass judgement. 
support,I actually thought he was an admin! 
oppose,See [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Alkivar|first adminship nomination]] from 3 months ago. 
oppose,Many of his edit summaries come across as rude and/or condescending. I would probably hate to read his justifications for speedy deleting pages. 
oppose,I gotta vote no. If you go to his talk page he literally told someone to "bite me" about a week ago. And looking at his other edits I still see a short fuse. 
oppose,<http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Totse&diff=15668954&oldid=15668836 This edit> does not convince me that the issues of civility from the last RfA have been dealt with. Even though Alkivar has done much good work some lack of good faith does not show a readiness for adminship. 
oppose,Too soon since last nomination to be able to show significant improvement given the concerns last time. I'm additionally concerned that a two day old user who has done little besides use Wikipedia to play chess (?!) is nominating someone to be an admin. 
oppose,I've reviewed much of his activity since the last RfA (what there is of it which isn't much) and what I see is a disturbingly high percentage of article edits without meaningful edit summaries (including a big long string of summaryless edits on [[Daniel Ruettiger]]). The <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Totse&diff=prev&oldid=15668954 "bite me"> comment doesn't help matters either. And if he is going to "stay away from VfD" as he promises and is just going to be doing "vandalism patrol" he can use just use godmodelite for the rollback button (or request rollback separately if and when we get a procedure for that). Sorry not enough time has passed since the last RfA and it looks like he spent most of it away from Wikipedia. There just isn't enough evidence that he's changed in any way. . 
oppose,As the recipient of the comment in question I of course found it less than civil. Bigger than that though was the lack of an apology and that the comment is just one more in a pattern of similar behavior. Admins are subject to greater scrutiny and civility does matter. Obviously Alkivar makes positive contributions so please keep doing that but I just don't think adminship is warranted. 
oppose,While "bite me" is pretty mild when it comes to angry remarks I think admins must always avoid being inflammatory. It's a minor quibble but I oppose.
oppose,I find I completely agree with Kelly Martin. 
oppose,Concerned about civility issues. 
oppose,User has disregarded consensus in the past. 
oppose,per Kelly Martin and because of the last RfA which I found disturbing. 
oppose,I see enough evidence of poor behavior to vote against. 
oppose,for now because of civility issues and inconsistent use of edit summaries. Maybe later. 
oppose,some significant contributions but he needs to show some common courtesy and selfcontrol. Maybe in a few months. 
oppose,Lack of civility. 
support,This user removes vandalism a lot. As an admin they could help more by banning users that continue to vandalise. 
support,for a very dedicated Wikipedian who's active in the community. I hope any who decide not to support this candidate can manage to be polite and fair.

support,Extreme Wisconsinite Now Living In Illinois ! I seriously honestly truly thought you were one already (no joking). 
support,the oppose votes are ridiculous (no offence intended ) 
support,Absolutely support. And for the record the start date is September 2004 over a year ago. 
support,Extreme [[Thunderwing]] support I've seen this user active on AfD. 
support,Alphax enjoys my full support 
support,!
support,BTW it pisses me off that an admin nomination gets a pile of AFD politics shoved onto it. I don't have to agree with Alphax to trust him with the tools 
support,Sadly concur with David Gerard. I strongly advise against inclusion of that extremely divisive question in future RFA's and if it is included I strongly caution all candidates against answering it lest another stupid pileon should result. This is a very strong admin candidate and those opposing him without good reason should ask themselves what good it does to the wiki to exclude good candidates on the grounds of AfD politics. 
support,I fear it's mostly symbolic now as the votes pile up. Frankly if I didn't already know Alphax and know that he is a lot smarter than this AfD would suggest I'd be seriously considering opposing too. 
support,I like the fact that he expresses opinions rather than hides them until after the election. Good answers on the extra questions! 
support,I am tired of being asked by this guy to do various admin things. Let him do them himself. And let me add my voice to those objecting to the interrogation of candidates about deletion policy. 
support,Echo thoughts of earlier support votes.
support,seems sufficiently familiar with policy the hordes of people opposing notwithstanding. 
support,Delete nn admincruft...I mean . 
support,He will be OK. 
support,The arbitrary addition of AFD quesions to this RFA is absurd. 
oppose,The answers to questions 5 and 6 strike me as naive. It's an unfortunate feature of AfD that most debates get say a handful of participants unless they are controversial or on high profile articles. A lot of the articles that go to AfD are frankly not worth much more than that. It would be verging on the absurd to close such debates as no consensus because they behave like the average AfD debate. The RfC noted in Q6 is frivolous and the defense given of it here is insulting to a large number of people including many who do not participate on AfD. If that's the most levelheaded this editor can be then they aren't ready for adminship for a while yet. The answer to Q1 is thorough but finishes with something of a personalised mission statement re AfD/VfU we have enough people on missions as it is and I though the RfC is specifically to condemn those who currently pursue one. 
oppose,Slash said it better then I could. Well slightly harsher then I'd say it too. 
oppose,Very weak oppose I agree with Splash on all he says so here's my very weak oppose. I do think starting the RfC was bold but also quite frivoulus. And we have way to many bold admins already. 
oppose,I thought the RfC was an interesting idea but the concept of closing Afd's with less than ten votes is ridiculous and completely unworkable.
oppose,The RfC was somewhere in the grey area between [[Wikipedia:Be bold in updating pages|Be Bold]] and [[WP:POINT]] but with the jumping on the bandwagon of the totally misunderstood and quite frankly sad editcountitis debate as well as his comment on consensus make me think that the RfC was geared more towards [[WP:POINT]] and future actions will head towards that way as well. However he did make me laugh in a good way with his comment on Redwolf24's RfB so much so that I 
oppose,I have to oppose based on question 5. If he's not going to call a vote with 9 votes to delete and 0 to keep a "delete" because it lacks 10 votes then we have a problem. Most debates on AfD don't get 10 votes. More than half are unanimous deletes but they usually have more like 4 or 5. 
oppose,per reasons given before. 
oppose,Strong Oppose Clearly Don't like the answers for 5 and 6. I dont trust this user with AFDs 
oppose,based on current answer to closing AfD. As I understand it closure is left to the judgement of the administrator. Disregarding a vote on the basis proposed does not seem appropriate. The voter would have indicated his/her views with the vote and may feel that reasons are adequately covered above for example in the nomination if supporting deletion. The approach proposed seems inconsistent with the community approach generally; in this forum support votes on RfA are not queried when they give no reason.
oppose,on AfD grounds particularly as AfD procedure specifically encourages participants [[WP:AFD#AfD_etiquette|not to "pile on"]] when the outcome is clear. Expecting 10 votes for a unanimous consensus is tacitly expecting Wikipedians to ignore this policy. | [[User Talk:Lomn|Talk]] / 
oppose,Very strong oppose. Alphax is a good user and makes a lot of good contributions. His comments below however suggest that he'd make a terrible admin. 
oppose,I'm sorry but I haven't been crazy about this user since I read the AfD RfC. Alphax's view on deletionists and inclusionists is clouding his judgment about consensus as seen in Q5. [[User Talk:Acetic Acid|Ac]][[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]][[User Talk:Acetic Acid|tic]][[Special:Random|']]
oppose,; do not trust on AfD. 
oppose,purely because he's being rude to people exercising their right to vote 'oppose' if they wish (see the above vote). Not conduct becoming an admin. 
oppose,per Proto. Admins need to defuse not enflame. 
oppose,If a user wants to start a debate over policy (such as AfD) they should do so in a talk forum not by trying to become and admin and unilaterally implementing a new policy themselves. The discretion given to admins on things like AfD closings blockings and speedy deletions is on a case by case basis to keep Wikipedia running smoothly; as reactions to previous incidents have shown it would be an abuse of administrator powers to use them in an effort to spark or influence policy debates. From the answers below I think that is what this user intends to do. 
oppose,rude and arrogant. 
oppose,I wholeheartedly agree with Alphax that AFD is in need of reform and would be happy to hear his suggestions. However until we have an alternative it is improper to unilaterally use the process in a way that is such a far cry from what is generally agreed upon. 
oppose,per Proto. Admins should try and adhere to the [[Wikipedia:Civility]] and [[Wikipedia:No personal attacks]] policies. If a user cannot do so even on their own Requests for adminship (a time when people are on their best behaviour) then that strikes me as a very bad sign indeed. Don't give a fig about AfD views though. 
oppose,Proto put it well; imho Alphax needs to calm down some before I can trust him as an admin. 
oppose,I'm bothered by the "how lame" comment above. I'd oppose for other reasons too but others have already commented on those sufficiently I think. 
oppose,If I'm reading his response to Q5.1 (below) correctly he's saying he'd close an AfD with say 8 or 9 unanimous delete votes as a keep?! That's way out of step with policy and community standards. Since there's every reason to believe this user could not be trusted to close AfD I must vote to oppose. 
oppose,mostly for reasons already listed by Proto and Acetic Acid. Filing an RfC against all inclusionists and all deletionists is as already pointed out a mix of being overly [[WP:BOLD]] and breaking [[WP:POINT]]; and I noticed from reading Wikienl last month that his views on the RfC are rather extreme. Threatening an RfC against a user is a rather serious matter whether you yourself have had any interaction with that user or not. Don't file an RfC against a club of users especially if you've only had minimal interaction with most of them. A lot of the "inclusionists" and "deletionists" do not do blind voting for keeping or deleting articles just because they are in a specific category; the summaries that they give at [[m:AIW]] and [[m:ADW]] shed more light on that; there's not really a "bloc" mentality among them aside from the most radical ones at either end of the inclusionist/deletionist spectrum. Also very few AfD's get 10 votes or more as already mentioned and waiting for 10 votes would only make our AfD backlogs that much more serious. 
oppose,due to the candidates stance on needing 10 votes to close an AFD. 
oppose,we don't need another admin who just does what he likes on AfD regardless of rules or the outcome of the votes. 
oppose,Strong Oppose per Lomn's research in the comments section and for incivility. A large portion of AfD deletion results are unanimous with fewer than ten votes vanity that wasn't quite speediable vanity spam band vanity etc. Closing admins get wide discretion but any personal closure guideline that would provide an automatic keep for so many articles that are regularly deleted and rightly so through AfD would be disastrous. Calling someone else's goodfaith vote "lame" on your own RfA is inexcusable.[[Wikipedia:Esperanza|a]]

support,Appleboy is a wonderful user and will be a great admin. 
oppose,I'm no fan of editcountitis and Appleboy is a good user but only 40 edits and literally only 7 article edits...that's not near experienced enough. Certainly with a bit more activity I'd reconsider but not at this stage.
oppose,May I ask? but are you insane? 40 edits? 
oppose,40 edits in 11 months. Come back when you have had some experience here. 
oppose,for above reasons. 
oppose,I do not normally oppose for editcountitis reasons but this is an exceptional case. Only 40 edits of which the vast majority are to his own userspace? That is clearly too few. 
oppose,I'd like to mention that a few days ago on the IRC channel <nowiki>#wikipedia</nowiki> AppleBoy kicked a regular user because he thought he was a "spammer". Someone who would take such rash action against another user really isn't ready to have blocking powers on Wikipedia edit count or no edit count.

support,I am absolutely convinced of this user's earnestness and sense of fairness judgment and a dash of humility are qualities an admin needs that can't easily be learned.

Just as I would not trust an editor w/o usage of good English so is the case with an admin. belive contribte serge consern busket 5 spelling mistakes in a selfnom coupled with bad grammar leave me with doubts if this is serious.

oppose,Today he removed a number of red links from [[List of male singers]] (example <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_male_singers&diff=prev&oldid=27147781>). Some of these were people who are linked from a number of articles. For example removing [[Mark Murphy]]. Doing a quick google test for "Mark Murphy" and jazz returns 98300 hits (<http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=%22Mark+Murphy%22+jazz&btnG=Google+Search>). Another removal of a red link (<http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Default&diff=prev&oldid=26276276>) was to a perfectly valid term in tennis. There's a reason for red links; they help show what articles are most needed (see [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Red Link Recovery|Red Link Recovery]] <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Most_wanted_articles#General>). Removing these links can actually disrupt Wikipedia. Placing this in juxtaposition of the [[Rod Strickland]] article created by you with redlinks (<http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rod_Strickland&diff=prev&oldid=26279859>) your handling of redlinks seems very unusual and perhaps too casual. I am also concerned about the removal of [[Abdul Kalam]] from [[21st century]] labeled as "Reverted POV" in edit summary (<http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=21st_century&diff=prev&oldid=26240043>). This person is the president of the 2nd largest (by population) country in the world. I have a hard time understanding how inclusion on a list of influential people in politics could be considered POV pushing. Dr. Kalam is still missing from that list. More care in deletions is needed; your impact here was negative and ongoing. There's also a curious deletion of content on the [[Nelly]] article (<http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nelly&diff=prev&oldid=26224711>). The edit summary says only "revert". The content deleted is very similar to the line right above it in the version where it was not yet deleted (<http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nelly&diff=prev&oldid=26223194>). On what grounds did you delete the content? I also have some mild objections to improper stub sorting (<http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Girvan_Dempsey&diff=prev&oldid=26313685> <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Kelly_%28U.S._politician%29&diff=prev&oldid=27022545>) which was later corrected by others (<http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Girvan_Dempsey&diff=next&oldid=26313685> <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=John_Kelly_%28U.S._politician%29&diff=next&oldid=27022545>) and improper speedy tagging of [[Lenny and Squiggy]] (<http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lenny_and_Squiggy&oldid=26314158>) which I feel was premature and was corrected a few hours later (<http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lenny_and_Squiggy&diff=26324526&oldid=26314158>). If you're not familiar with a topic you should be careful before tagging it much less speedy deleting it. Any of these things by themselves would not be sufficient for me to vote oppose. But taken as a whole I feel there is a pattern of behavior that shows the nominee to be too quick to judge and less careful than needed for an administrator. I do feel the nominee's heart is in the right place. Given improvement in carefulness of their approach to deletions of articles and content and a few months time I may be inclined to support. 
oppose,too soon be patient and go forth and produce edits. 
oppose,way too soon. There is no need for rush so maybe you should wait at least a few months before nominating yourself once more. 
oppose,previous RfA was too recent. Patience is a virtue and adminship isn't going anywhere. I've been here years without trying to get get the mop I'm living proof that it's possible to last a few months! 
oppose,Too soon. 
oppose,too soon after old nom. Seems a bit over eager for adminship and also per Durins reasons. 
oppose,My understanding was that this renomination would happen in late November and if it had I would have supported. Adminship isn't a big deal there's no hurry. I expect to support early next year. 
oppose,Durin makes a very convincing argument here. I simply do not feel this user has enough experience on wikipedia yet. Also renominating for RFA less than a month later strikes me as showing lack of experience with the typical RFA process. In a few months I might consider supporting but for right now I have to say "oh hell no"

He's a great dedicated editor and people like him who are very good at reverting vandalism are people that we need in the admin ranks.

support,Active fighting vandals and no matter what some people think that is a huge problem and I think Aranda would be a huge plus in that cause. 
support,( 
oppose,Aranda is a really really nice person... but rspeer makes a very valid point. Admins are supposed to be an example of wikipedia to the community at large; as such admins should at least be able to spell and punctuate properly (I'm not as big of a grammar nazi since we have british australian american etc... grammar rule systems in place here). It is rather hard to take someone seriously when their signature includes "watz sup" as a link to their talk page and when they are spelling quite atrociously. Sorry Aranda I'm glad you know you need help but I just don't feel making you an admin is a good idea at this point. 
oppose,His intention to delete "vanity articles" and the like is worrying when he nominates AFDs like "nn roadcruft d". 
oppose,Weak oppose because of lack of submission to the tyranny of tradition. Aranda is a pretty good editor and if he were a great editor I'd support regardless but I'm just pushed over the edge by the poor English. 
oppose,per SPUI. 
oppose,Moderate Oppose. It's taken me part of an afternoon to come to a decision on this one. Unfortunately I cannot in good faith vote I agree with many of the reasons that have been given in this section. Perhaps it's just me I have a penchant for trying to make sure that I am understood and that I understand people but the colloquism style that this user chooses to employ in his pages makes me a tad uncomfortable. We hold Admins up with high and mighty standards proper grammar and word usage is among those standards in my mind. My apologies to Aranda and to Karmafist. 
oppose,Martin's comments perfectly summarize my feelings. 
oppose,I hate to say this but this "I also voted delete because I dont know if its exists" kind of bothered me if someone doesn't "know" about something maybe further research or not voting might be more appropriate. The second to last sentence in the sock explanation (I normally vote the opposite of what annons do unless its something true) is confusing and doesn't show a lot of thought. Good vandal fighter/attitude...a little more focus and I'd love to support next time if this doesn't work out. 
oppose,Aranda56 has been doing good work and I hope he feels welcome to continue making these valuable contributions but his problems with communication make me reluctant to give him more power. It's hard to tell how well he thinks things through because he doesn't explain his thinking clearly. 
oppose,I hate to hold someone's poor English skills against him but I'm compelled to do so. An administrator must be capable of dealing directly with other users (to discuss his/her administrative actions explain how the site operates et cetera). Jorge's relative lack of communication skills would prevent him from properly carrying out these responsibilities. I would be willing to tolerate some typos and misspellings but Jorge's misused words and unintelligible syntax are likely to confuse (or even offend) fellow editors. 
oppose,per false accusations of sock puppetry and false reverts of vandalism and general lacking of [[WP:AGF]]. Not to mention existence of multiple accounts self nominations and this being the 3rd such self nomination. We don't need admins that act like that. 
oppose,I'm sorry to oppose but there are three reasons I have to do this. Firstly I have severe misgivings about nominating someone with such bad grammar as per above. If Jorge showed even a small inclination to improve this would not be an issue but he seems to wear it like a badge of honor. After freakofnurture had cleaned up some of the bad grammar he changed it back with the following edit summary <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Aranda56&diff=29974358&oldid=29972985 I like my old version better thanks anyways kept some of your editing though> (specifically look at what he did to the section ==What I Do Here== on line 67). At the end of the day this is a resource for the whole world. The lingo that Jorge uses is fine in his neighborhood where all the locals have grown up with the slang but how will users without English as a first language deal with such poorly constructed sentences? Secondly I am also worried by his reaction to <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Aranda56&diff=27388445&oldid=27383562 stressful situations>. He seems particularly susceptible to baiting from vandals. Will this overreaction happen when he dealing with difficult editors? Thirdly Jorge seems to want adminship too much. His first two unsuccessful nominations were self noms the last one being less than one month ago. In my opinion Jorge needs more time to get to know all the ins and outs of editing. He spends a lot of time fighting vandals and that is great but it is only through editing that he will learn how to collaborate with other editors and learn how to deal with the more subtle differences of opinion that appear when editing pages. 
oppose,although somewhat reluctantly. For one thing it still seems a little soon after he nominated and withdrew himself from two previous RfAs the last only a few weeks ago. I'm not horribly concerned about the spelling and grammar (as he says on his talk page he attends the "worst school on earth" so that may be the cause of it! but I do expect a little more care to be taken. If he were a nonnative speaker of English that would be one thing but the mistakes show either a knowing willingness to not use proper English (such as the talk page which would be fine if it was confined there) or they show he does not want to spend the time to improve things. Looking over his edit summaries ("uptated" "sppedy delete" "acually") I can only surmise it is the latter as you manage to spell these words correctly at other times. The spelling and grammar alone would not make me vote delete but the fact that on the one hand you seem to want the adminship badly but on the other can't be bothered to take a little extra time to write things properly (especially on important pages such as this very AfD) combined with some of the other concerns voiced above makes me vote oppose at this time. 
oppose,based on the language skills seen no only in past edits but on this RfA... basic sentence structure frequently gets mangled. This is not what we should be putting forward as one of our Admins. 
oppose,English Wikipedia does NOT need another emotionally unstable admin. Sorry kid! 
oppose,Too soon after last self nom aslo quitting because of a comment is very questionable in admin behavior. What if you got into a dispute of somesort would you user your powers to win? I can't be certain fromt he asnwers given. 
oppose,for now. Not enough time since last RFA.
oppose,Not yet maybe later. 
oppose,I am so sorry but I oppose for now. 
oppose,for the time being. Keep at the vandalwhacking and take a shot writing some articles. 
support,Im in support u. Your articles are greatly structured and have great content. You seem to contribute a lot of minor articles and with admin powers u should b able to move onto larger edits.
oppose,sorry Ari... I'm happy to welcome another Sydneysider but it is clear from your articles that you are not yet familiar with the [[WP:MOS|Manual of Style]] here at Wikipedia which is very important to know when editing articles. Further you have not made that many contributions or had enough experience in the moderation and discussion side of Wikipedia to be an administrator yet. I'm sure with some time and enough further experience you can try become an administrator. 
oppose,I agree with . You've only made 49 edits to the article space. 
oppose,There is no nomination statement the user has few edits the request was not formatted the nomination was not accepted... the editor didn't put the requisite thought into this. Come back in six months. 
oppose,per above. User has little edits and need more experience. 
oppose,per above 
oppose,per above and requesting delisting. 
oppose,Oppose. Too few edits. I'd advise a withdrawal too. 
oppose,Lack of edit summaries. Under 500 edits. 
oppose,too soon too few edits lacking edit summaries etc. 
oppose,Oppose per and . Try again in a bit perhaps ;> </big> [[User_Talk:Vilerage|Reply]][[Special:Emailuser/Vilerage|Spam Me!]]</strong>

oppose,See the edit history of [[English words of Persian origin]] for why I oppose this request. 
support,Good Wikipedian. 
oppose,as he seems to have little familiarity with basic policy. More edit summaries would be nice too. 
oppose,Too inexperienced at the moment. Good editor but needs to become more familiar with policy before becoming an admin. 
oppose,Not this time possibly later. Joyous's comments cover it well you also clearly don't realise that any Wikipedian can vote on vfd not just admins. Actually you seem a little too keen on the whole deletion business for my tastes to be honest. Overall you seem to have potential though but well as I said not this time. 
oppose,As far as I can see does not meet my 
oppose,Not at this time. 
oppose,Not yet. 
oppose,Oppose. No summaries for edits.

support,because there's no more coffe left. 
support,That's hot. 
support,decent guy. 
support,Need more RC patrol. 
support,(This page also has a [[Wikipedia talk:Requests for adminship/Babajobu|talk page]].) 
support,Considering all the hard work it takes to work on articles related to the Middle East and other contentious topics. Babajobu puts in alot of work and remains neutral even though he often has strong opinions about any given subject. He is not unidimensional editor like some people but instead works on all area's of wikipedia functioning. In many ways Babajou is the sort of Admin I would like to become. Someone who can openly have an a opinion yet be counted on to be fair and balanenced. Unlike some people Babujobu is not secretive about where he stands nor does he turn tail and then complain about things. Instead he seeks a concensus based upon evidence. I strongly urge RfA voter's to consider babajobu's total record and to vote based on the merits and not out of some sense of political considerations. 
support,without a doubt. 
oppose,Strong Oppose During my rfa he tried to negatively influence people to gather opposition against me and when certain voters supported me he tried to discourage them and to change their vote to oppose <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AJayjg&diff=26604561&oldid=26597033> behind my back. The sad thing about this was that I had never even met him then so it was very shocking for me to see an editor I had never had any dispute with before go to such lengths to gather opposition. He also takes sides with a certain group of editors many of which push an extreme POV on Islamrelated articles. Sorry but I think giving him admin powers at this time will do more bad than good. 
oppose,Oppose. A close call. Obviously a good editor and certainly knows Strunk & White backwards and forwards. A cursory examination of his work however reveals evidence of a certain lack of tact. I’m talking specifically about edit summaries that read “your hateful behavior”: <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Idleguy&diff=prev&oldid=20334681> and brisk dismissals of competing viewpoints as “preposterous”: <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=English_grammar&diff=prev&oldid=21811314> and “ridiculous”: <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=English_grammar&diff=prev&oldid=21805242> Not quite the level of poise I would associate with an admin. I had to do a lot of thinking on this one but it’s a no. 
oppose,in light of his conduct regarding [[user:Anonymous editor|Anonymous editor]]s RfA. 
oppose,Weak Oppose. I share the concerns of AE and Brandon.
oppose,Weak oppose While I'm sure you will concentrate on edit summaries now that it has been pointed out I think it's a habit that needs to be in place before the nomination. 
oppose,User has a history of abrasive conduct (especially with regard to grammar eg the Village Pump discussion on spelling numbers of below one hundred.) I could support one day if the user shows more flexibility and a greater spirit of compromise in future. 
oppose,I am not incredibly impressed with the editor's behavior regardless of the AE incident. Good as an editor but I do not believe I would ever vote for him. 
oppose,Strong Oppose. Sandpaper edit summaries somewhat POV edits tends to take jokes too far. 
oppose,for reasons above but would still like to learn more about sandpaper edit summaries. 
oppose,for reasons above. 
oppose,Sorry but your user account has too few edits (310) on too little time (about a month). Course this is coming from the guy that...I'll spare you the story. If you stuck around for a few more months and rack up at least 750 edits (not that I'm saying this is an absolute number it just sounds right ;)) then I'd vote for. 
oppose,Oppose due to lack of experience. Bancroftian only 310 total edits <http://kohl.wikimedia.org/~kate/cgibin/count_edits?user=Bancroftian&dbname=enwiki>. Also the nomination was wrong in many aspects and had to be fixed by Illyanep (see comments). Finally since this was a selfnomination the questions should have been answered when this was first posted. 
oppose,Irregularities in placing the RfA as described in comments show that the user could benefit from a bit more experience first. But by all means do try after you get more edits under your belt! 
oppose,Sorry but I think you're too inexperienced to become an admin. Come back when you've made two or three thousand edits and shown that you are familiar with everything an administrator needs to be familiar with. 
oppose,Too few edits too little time...May the Force be with you! 
oppose,If you had a few more i'd vote neutral but sorry bud the intro tipped me into the oppose column. Come back in a thousand edits and keep up the good attitude. 
oppose,Strongest Opposition Possible Has no idea what administrators do. Look at the answer to the first question. Admins are just fancy editors. They have other duties. Plus you could use a few hundred more edits. 
oppose,Bancroftian is on the right track but needs more experience. 
oppose,ditto. 
oppose,Has not even accepted selfnomination. 
support,Good User 1000 edits is a little small but I'm willing to overlook it
support,As long as his last name isn't Simpson. ;) 
support,Edits seem useful and I recognize the name. I support. 
support,Looks good to me. 
support,I generally expect users to have 1200 edits before requesting adminship but I can be flexible. 1166 edits is good enough. And I like his work. 
support,Cool. 
support,Heh I started editing when I was 12 became admin when I was 13... 
oppose,I am hesitant. 3 months and 1000 edits is a pretty quick promotion in general. But this chap is in 6th grade. I'm sure he's a fine and responsible fellow. But for someone still in elementary school I'd rather see a somewhat longer history & evidence of behavior in tense situations. Another couple months. Nothing personal at all I suppose I'm just an age bigot. 
oppose,I looked through his edit history. Over the past few days he's <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Will_geary&action=history put a speedy tag on something up for VFD> (presumably he didn't check the edit history when it was vandalized instead just slapping a speedy tag on it <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Gianni_Versace&diff=prev&oldid=7655787 something that happened before as well>). I also found numerous grammatical errors when reverting such as <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lesli_Kay&diff=prev&oldid=10277266> and <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Live_Killers&diff=prev&oldid=10279682>. All this combined with listing [[Fruit Brute]] for deletion (the article was vandalized but the history of the article was still there and the article itself still had content establishing its notability) and the other objections raised lead me to believe that he's not ready for adminship yet. I'd likely support later. 
oppose,the hell out of this one. this user not only has been editing for 2 months is one of the youngest users of wikipedia being in 6th grade I do not feel this user has the maturity level to handle the power. This can be seen by his "not notable" reasoning of an item produced before his birth that he put up for VfD without even a simple google. If people like this become admins I'll become an exuser. 
oppose,Maybe after more edits. 
oppose,He's on the right track but 2 months of activity and 1100 edits just isn't enough. What clinched it for me was the [[Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Fruit Brute|Fruit Brute VFD]]. A Google query turns up over 1000 hits. With a bit more experience I will support. 
oppose,and extremely so. Maybe after a few more years of schooling and experience but placing adminship responsibilities in the hands of someone who has yet to reach middle school is not a wise idea. Also agree that his edit count is somewhat inflated due to minor copy editing. Granted minute copy editors are needed but that does not convey to me that the person is ready to handle admin responsibilities. Furthermore this person has not displayed the maturity level that I would expect to see on VfD and has made several unnecessary listings. Closing comments: keep up the good work and try again a few years from now. [[en:RaD Man|RaD Man]] (
oppose,Adminship is not a reward it is a position of responsibility. 
oppose,I'll want to see evidence of a longer editing history at Wikipedia before I can consider supporting. As said I may be an age bigot (I teach 6th grade you see) but a user as young as will need to demonstrate considerable maturity before I can see myself supporting a vote for adminship. 
oppose,Editcountitis may not be good but <http://kohl.wikimedia.org/~kate/cgibin/count_edits?hash=7f40f6e535fff5f291e4fb4fca1b50584e3e3d9b&user=Beau99&dbname=enwiki 561 edits> in over a year is a too slow edit rate for an admin to have. Also this user doesn't use edit summaries very often (almost never). His interaction with other users is almost nil with just 6 edits in user talk and 27 in Wikipedia namespace. Keeping your head down and working may be good but not good enough for adminship.May the Force be with you! 
oppose,Ok this turned into quite the speech but I want to be clear on my reasoning. My general baseline is four months and 2000 edits. However I'm willing to bend that in cases where one of those being stronger makes up for one being less particularly on the time side or in cases where I know the user well enough to get a sense of their suitability. However I have not had any opportunity to interact with you and I generally am strongly disinclined to support with anything less than 1000 edits. Considering that that number is also over a yearlong period that shows a level of participation that I do not think is enough for adminship. Part of why I feel that way is I am concerned that with infrequent participation you may not be able to keep up with policy. This came up in another user's RfA recently and in that case I felt confident with both that user's participation level and attention level to policy. However I note a couple things in your RfA: First you use the term "Votes for Deletion". VfD has in the past few months been renamed "Articles for Deletion". I myself am still getting used to that change but I have a hard time being convinced you will be able to know policy well with that kind of error. Second your user signature does not seem to link to your user page. I believe it is important for an admin to have a clear signature that easily links to both their user and talk pages to facilitate communication. Third you describe in your answers to the questions below that you would attempt to resolve disputes offsite. I question the wisdom of this. One of the advantages that we have with the wiki process is that everything is completely transparent. Nothing that we do on this site is hidden and every edit comment and action is reviewable and for the most part reversable. If you attempt conflict resolution offsite there is absolutely no evidence of what transpired. Having that evidence is helpful in that it may serve to protect you should you be wrongly accused of misaction by another user. Also in your introduction you state that you have more edits than you can count which in my first read made me think that you were claiming to have a large edit count however that is not the case. I am sure that was not intentional but I want you to be aware of the impression that I got. I'm sorry this is such a soapbox but I like to be clear in my reasoning. I hope that you will continue to provide an excellent contribution to the project. Best regards 
oppose,Per Shreshth91. 
oppose,The edits seem to be good (apart from the lack of summaries) but there aren't really enough of them over such a long time period. You also mention you want to help oversee VfD yet you have only contributed to three discussions on it. 
oppose,per Evilphoenix. I am the last person to get a case of editcountitis but I don't see enough experience with Wikipedia policy and such to qualify a support vote. Also misspelling "privileges" while it doesn't affect your potential performance as an admin really leaves me with a bad taste in my mouth. Sorry. 
oppose,Near complete absence from project over the last 90 days (just 34 edits in that time period). Large gaps over time in contributions. Why would you want the admin tools if you're rarely here? 
oppose,for the third time today per reasons above. 
oppose,per above. 
oppose,per above 
oppose,Do I need to say "per above"? 
support,very good edit history will support wikipedia's NPOV. 
support,Good candadite great edit summaries. Too many with editcountitis around here [[File:Sad.gif|20x20px]] 
support,good editor understands NPOV head seems firmly screwed to neck.
support,I like his idea of exploiting the time zone advantage to revert vandalism. I will support again if his 'inexperience' makes the community withhold consensus now. 
support,how 18 months is not enough experience is beyond me. Editcountitis are bad.
oppose,excellent history but not enough edits for me otherwise try again after 1500 edits and I'll support.
oppose,I don't care about your edit count as a whole but your lack of edits in the Wikipedia namespace indicates a lack of experience in terms of RFA voting VfDs etc. I'll gladly support in a few more months. 
oppose,You've got only a few Wikipedia namespace edits so you might not be familiar enough with policies and practices yet to be an admin. The overall edit count is not a problem in my opinion but you need to show that you're familiar with Wikipedia's structure to get votes here. Other than that you sound like a good contributor and I'll definitely support after a few more months and say 150 Wikipedia namespace edits. 
oppose,900 edits in 17 months is a bit few. Needs to be more consistent with edit summaries. Lastly shows limited grasp of Wiki policy if he calls <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Helen_Clark&diff=prev&oldid=22215596 this edit> 'reverting vandalsim'. Seem like a consistent editor nontheless; come back in a few months and youll have my full support. </sup/><p style="fontfamily: Bradley Hand ITC Comic Sans MS;">
oppose,I'm not too worried about where you edit (Wiki namespace or just article space) but I am worried about the number. Even 1000 over 18 months isn't that much. I'd like to see an admin have more than 50 edits a month. That isn't too much more than one edit a day on average. Perhaps later I could support. 
oppose,It's great to have editors that are passionate about certain topics but I'm not sure that the narrow focus on New Zealandrelated articles is grounds for the admin mop. In addition I would prefer to see more edits in the Wikipedia namespace before I would feel comfortable supporting. 
oppose,Will support in one month. 
oppose,not enough edits. 
oppose,Too new. 
oppose,Looks like a good editor but what's wrong with waiting a bit? I think there is nothing wrong with maintaining that admins should be more experienced. Keep editing as you have and adminship will come in time. 
oppose,"editcountitis" tempered with judgement is not a vice. While you shouldn't promote somebody purely based on an impressive edit count there is nothing wrong with telling a good user to keep editing for a little while before reapplying. I will wholeheartedly support after another month or so of steady editing. 
oppose,oppose not enough experience. 
oppose,per MONGO 
support,not an especially voluminous record of contributions but appears unlikely to abuse admin tools based on his established committment to the project. 
support,per Christopher Parham. I see no reason to deprive this user of the tools. He (or she) has been here almost a year and has been averaging over 250 mostly substantial edits per month since September. This is obviously someone who has been devoting substantial time to Wikipedia and has not made a notable misstep. Let's give him the tools to do the job better. 
support,After having a good look through his contributions he seems a very decent editor and most worthy of being an admin. I certainly see no reason not to trust him with admin priviliges. 
support,I get the impression that most of the neutral and opposing comments ultimately go back to various forms of editcounting. Evaluating the quality of contributions on the other hand shows that this editor eminently understands Wikipedia's aims and can be trusted to advance them. 
support,The key is he won't abuse his powers. 
support,no reason to vote oppose has been presented. 
support,We need more admins (see that [[WP:RM|backlog]]?) and nothing indicates that this candidate would abuse the tools. Come back soon if you don't make it this time 
support,While I agree with the comments of the opposers and the neutrals I think Bkwillwm can do a lot of productive work as an admin in the areas with which he is familiar. I don't see him chasing sockpuppets or closing AfDs in the near future but there are other people to do that. Not every admin has to be a jackofalltrades and I don't see any risk of him abusing his power as an admin. 
oppose,You do make good edits but appear to be lacking in areas of the project notably: Interaction with other users projects and policies. Making use of User_talk is an essential part of dealing with vandals. 
oppose,per Xaosflux (who has excellent taste in names!) While I respect your fine record thus far I need more project interaction before I am comfortable seeing you as an admin. 
oppose,No problem with any edits I see but I echo the need for more involvement in the project namespace and more discussion on user pages especally if you are reverting vandalism (Look at the {{tl|test}} messages for example). | [[User talk:Asbestos|<FONT COLOR="#808080">Talk </FONT]]> 
oppose,Less than 50 wikiname space edits 
oppose,lack of experience with process as remarked above.

support,seems like a good bloke. 
support,Not having seen bob ruling around the same places I've been I smaple checked some of bob's contributions seems to be fine and see no reason not to support. 
support,Bob_rulz is an asset to Wikipedia. If he hadn't selfnom'd I'd have nominated him myself. He contributes to numerous articles and is the type of user who contributes content which needs alot less editing. If more Wikipedians contributed as much quality content as Bob_rulz there would be alot more articles written much better. [[User:JonMoore| 
support,Valuable edits and contributions to dispute resolution. 
support,I see no reason against this candidate but providing edit summaries would be much better.
support,as long as you use more edit summaries
oppose,Only 3% of the user's edits are outside of user and article name spaces. Lack of contribution in other namespaces is problematic. Uses edit summaries just 22% of the time. I like to see a minimum of >80% and prefer 90%. 
oppose,per . </sup/><p style="fontfamily: Bradley Hand ITC Comic Sans MS;">
oppose,More community interaction is needed for successful use of admin powers. 
oppose,I'm sorry since your article work is good. But the other namespaces Wikipedia: and wikipedia talk: in particular are very different beasts to the articles. Also there's not a lot in User talk: which makes onetoone interaction tough to guage. A little more experience behindthescenes would do the power of good. Also don't underestimate the importance of providing an edit summary at least 99.9% of the time including minor edits! It makes RC patrol less painful and studying ones watchlist more productive. In the meantime keep up the article stuff! 
oppose,Your article edits are good but more Wikipedia: and User talk: namespace edits are needed. 
oppose,Ignoring edit summaries makes RC patrolling that much harder on the rest of us.
oppose,Too few Wikipedia space edits. 
oppose,Sorry far too few WP namespace edits to make me comfortable supporting. 
oppose,due to lack of experience and other reasons cited above. 
oppose,Good writer/editor but paucity of edit sumaries is troubling. 
support,Of course! after all I nominated him! 
support,of course. What took you so long? 
support,No Bot could do his job probably wouldn't want to either. 
support,Gnomes like this are a treasure. 
support,till he came and &nbsp'd; some of my articles I had no idea there was a MoS. May he keep up the good work behind the scenes. =
support,definitely. I have entertained the notion of nominating him/her myself several times in the past. 
support,SUPPORT. i have reviewed the opposition votes and bobblewik's work. i see no reason to oppose this nomination. 
support,I have agonised about this. Bobblewick is courteous and thoughtful and extremely assiduous. However I think his/her rather strict and pedantic changes to SI units can be very annoying and disruptive for example m&sup2; where hectare would be more appropriate and km&sup3; where billion m&sup3; is more comprehensible. Some professions and industries habitually use units that are not not metric and others use metric units that are not SI. However a move to standardisation of units is helpful to an encyclopedia. Being human rather than a bot (!) I hope Bobblewick will restrict to (1) making SI units only an alternative rather than replacing the previous units and (2) not intrude on the "flow" of a wellwritten narrative. In my experience Bobblewick has not reverted when his/her changes have been removed. 
support,Some disagreement we have over hectares are hardly a reason to oppose. A very pleasant person to work with remarkably courteous always willing to explain and discuss the reasoning behind changes. 
support,I have found Bobblewik to be a courteous and intelligent editor and open to discussion on any edit they make. While I am not sure that the admin powers will be used very much this has never been a requirement for adminship. 
support,with much the same reservations as above. I don't agree with Bobblewik's acrosstheboard standardisations (hectares yards and so on can be the most appropriate units to use occasionally) but nevertheless I feel that the sheer amount of donkeywork he's put in is admirable. If he were to be just a little less rigid on the matter of units and accept that in some cases clarity is more important than total consistency my support would be wholehearted. 
support,Cool. 
support,Conditional Bobblewik my hat off to you to making a huge dent in the 'pedia! However I will only support you if you are a little more cautious in your edits (see Klonimus' oppose vote). However in the spirit of the Wiki I will [[Wikipedia:Assume good faith|assume good faith]] and give you my support! | 
oppose,due to use of misleading edit summaries and overuse of minor edit checkbox.All of his edit summaries are "units" or more recently "units possibly using google convertor" and marked minor even for nonminor nonunit changes. 
oppose,Bobblewik consistently adds and readds (and readds!) conversions to articles in a way that prioritizes the conversions over quality of writing or commonsense. Even when his conversions are deleted even when they make little sense (like adding hundreds of thousands of meters to a number of acres) and when he's asked to stop he keeps reverting. The [[Wikipedia:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] is not policy and it specifically states that these conversions are not mandated. It further states that the usage of the country the article relates to should prevail so he should not be making these changes at all in some articles. Both of these points have been made to Bobblewik but he just ignores them. I'll add more to the comments section later. 
oppose,Reluctantly oppose. Like SlimVirgin I've never seen him except with his metrification labors. A good contributor certainly one who I've called upon before but I'm hesitant to give powers to someone with so little breadth of experience. 
oppose,Bobblewik changes units for fields which he knows little about. He changed billion m&sup3; to km&sup3; in several petroleum related articles with complete disregard for industry and common use standards. Billion m&sup3; albeit confusing is in common use for the measurement of natural gas volumes. I appreciate his help standardizing units but he is anothr case of a user modifyin articles in fields which they have little experience. Not helpful...
oppose,Bobblewik changes units for fields which he knows little about. In [[Town Gas]] he changed the normal units for expressing the caloric value of a gas (Btu/scf (Btu per standard cubic foot) to MJ/m3 which is not the industry or common use standard. As well some the conversions got garbled resulting in the some of the information in the article now being incorrect. I appreactie the spellchecking and cleanups but not the metrification campaign. Certain encyclopedia subjects use units that are metric but not SI or conventional or even a mixture (I.e canning/autoclaving 121*C at 15psi pressure). that needs to be resepected and not clobbered. 
oppose,Looks like a valuable contributor but ingoring repeated requests to use conventional units does not seem like admin material to me. Add the metric units if needed but don't replace them. Beyond that a total lack of balance in editing and no edits that would require adminship would lead me to say just keep contributing and don't worry about adminship unless you want to go out for more balance in editing and be responsive to requests. 
oppose,Weak oppose. His unit conversions are valuable but he is often insensitive or stubborn in cases where it is not clear what the proper usage is. He is uncompromising in his beliefs that whatever he believes to be the most technically correct SI unit should always be used. He seems to be more interested in what is "correct" than in what is most helpful to the reader. In discussing these matters he is civil gives cogent rationales for what he does and is obviously wellinformed. Nevertheless I feel that in these matter he is pushing a point of view. It is not an unreasonable point of view but he pushes it. 
oppose,Bobblewiki seems dedicated to units but I don't actually see much participation in other aspects of the Wiki which I think is necessary for an Admin
oppose,I have found him completely unwillingly to consider opposing opinions with respect to the use of hectares and unwilling to attempt to build consensus. He has very little experience in areas outside of his quest to insert his favorite metric units irregardless of way units are used in practice. 
oppose,As pointed out above Bobblewick's contributions are a nuisance as often as not as he does not appear to consider or care about context. 
oppose,Seems like an excellent user but I can't overlook the concerns of so many other editors that this user does not play well with others. Willing to support in the future. 
oppose,Unfortunately oppose. Bobblewik obviously does some important work but as far as I can tell it's very limited in scope. Normally that wouldn't be very important to me but that such a large percentage of his work has been fiddling with measurement numbers (and has apparently managed to provoke some controversy in the process) however useful that is pushes me into the oppose camp. 
oppose,I don't think so. 
oppose,Boothy wants to oppose all of us let us return the favor. 
oppose,Nuhu no way no how Hell is still hot as well hell and this week contains only one thursday. 
oppose,Um... No. 
oppose,While Jason seems to be a good editor his RFC is way too recent. If he were to adjust his attitude towards the project and could be good for a while I would support him. 
oppose,noting the RfC this guy's upset too many people lately. 
oppose,That's so not hot. 
oppose,No way Hell hasn't frozen over quite yet he has a very bad attitude when it comes to admins and people with authority as well as the fact that he has an open RFC which I would not use as a reason to oppose except for the fact that he appears to be entirely blowing it off with no regard for his fellow users. 
oppose,Here's a good Boothy quote for ya: "STOP LYING ABUSIVE ADMINS QUESTION AUTHORITY TRUST NOBODY EPICALLY ADMINS". Anyway I think not. 
support,User has contributed to a number of pages and done good work in the Userbox project 16:54 2 January 2006 (UTC) User's 3rd edit. →
oppose,Too few edit summaries. Use more the preview button. 
oppose,I have come across him deliberately adding fake data into an article. An IP editor and created a vanity page called [[Omer Sheikh]]. When I put it up for deletion at [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Omer Sheikh]] Bourbons apparently in an attempt to save the article added content to the article to the effect that Sheikh has played international [[cricket]] matches for [[English cricket team|England]]. No such player has ever appeared in international or domestic cricket in any country. An admin can check the old contents of this article and corroborate what I have said. 
oppose,because of the answers to the questions below.
oppose,His attitudes in his edits to [[RuneScape quests]] few edit summaries little if none vandalism fighting. 
oppose,for several reasons. First of all his presentation of himself in this self nom: those "roughly 3 months" are not even 2 (first edit was November 8) and the near 1000 edits are closer to 600. Second the support vote he got was by someone with a 4 day old account with two previous edits. Third his nomination (and his sig) has a lot of spelling and typing errors. Wikipedians don't have to be perfect but it doesn't lead me to believe that this user is careful enough to be a trustworthy admin. The nature of his edits and his lack of edit summaries add to that feeling even more. And last of all the last sentence in his answer to the last question makes me pretty certain that this user is either trolling or doesn't grasp much of the way things are (or should be) done here. 
oppose,per all. Sorry. →
oppose,I just found <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=RuneScape_Quests&diff=33021595&oldid=32994842 this cut and paste move> made five days ago: when it was reverted by this user rereverted with the edit summary DO NOT REDIRECT THIS IS ORIGINAL AND PROPER PAGE FOR INFORMATION. I have therefore changed my vote from neutral to oppose. 
support,If Ed can support him given their history then I see no reason to oppose. 
support,support from first hand experience. 
support,BYT will make a fine admin. 
support,support 
support,Very Strong . From first hand experience he will make be a great admin . And seeing that he & Ed have resolved their disputes I think he will do really good . 
support,Even in the heat of a dispute he worked within and respected the dispute resolution system so his being an admin will work out fine. 
support,Highly Great editor who has consistently promoted NPOV to the highest manner in many different articles and has reverted vandalism in many articles by anon IPs. I highly recommend him for this post. 
support,In my experience he has been extremely levelheaded and calm in his editing even under great provocation. 
support,Very good editor who keeps cool under the hundreds of personal attacks EnviroKainKabong and his sockpuppets have leveled at him.
support,apart from being a good editor if Ed Poor nominated him then I can only support. 
support,I support because of "complaint at Wikipedia:Requests for Mediation against Ed Poor most of which Ed Poor himself quickly deleted while transferring it to a talk page" 
support,Works on controversial articles that are infested with very motivated POV pushers and generally improves them. I think all you should need to become an admin is to generally be in credit and Brandon is. 
support,Clearly Ed Poor didn't make this nomination in good faith. Unfortunately he seems to be succeeding with his setup. 
support,He has strong views but he's been good at applying them to maintaining NPoV rather than allowing them to overbalance articles in the other direction. I'd trust him as an admin. 
support,Should be "no big deal". 
support,POV biases are worth noting as they are in the case of Mzajac who shows a strong Ukrainian nationalist bent in his edits but they are no reason to oppose the nomination just as they are not in the case of Mzajac; admins are not editors. 
support,I have decided this nomination would have been better at another time however I'm assuming good faith. 
support,Not sure if this is too late I only Checked my talk page just now. he works well and neutrally with a healthy respect of the Guidlines and wikipedia policy. 
oppose,Looking at his user page I'd rather oppose. 
oppose,Looking at his user page I'm surprised Ed Poor even nominated this guy at all. 
oppose,I'd prefer that candidates aren't engaged in ongoing disputes...even with their nominator. Strange. 
oppose,Brandon left a note on my talk page saying his nomination was connected to resolving a dispute between him and Ed which sounds a bit odd. <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASlimVirgin&diff=0&oldid=15578675> 
oppose,because almost his entire user page deals with "complaint at Wikipedia:Requests for Mediation against Ed Poor most of which Ed Poor himself quickly deleted while transferring it to a talk page". 
oppose,His user page is too confrontational. 
oppose,1070 edits is not enough to be comfortable with all aspects of Wiki seems to be at war with other users does not appear user would actually benefit from admin capabilities. probably a good user admin no way. 
oppose,Doesn't respect important Wikipedia policies not suitable as an admin. 
oppose,Generic reason: I don't think that 1081 edits (editcountitis can be fatal) many of them not being major edits is enough for qualification for adminiship. Specific reason: I have found with Brandon a willingness to espouse very Sunni centric material on the [[Talk:Hadith#Reply_to_Brandon.27s_edits|talk page of Hadith]] I found him to be someone difficult in not wanting to show alternative material (not that it is nearly as notable as the Sunni view). He's not a bad user by any means but with his relative inexperience and me not being convinced that he'd keep NPOV and resolve problems well I must oppose. If he's nominated later down the road I'd consider changing my vote. 
oppose,Strongly Oppose BrandonYusufToropov has repeatedly gotten involved with Yuber's antics.
oppose,Brandon's edits show a strong pro Islam slant/ agenda of which he is entitled to but this does not speak well of the attribute of impartiality which is highly important and which we would expect from an admin.
oppose,Oppose. 
oppose,I have observed this nomination unfold over the course of the past few days and have decided that I can't vote support. One of the reasons for this is the user's lack of experience on the Wikipedia; I am by no way questioning the quality of his edits but he still needs more time in activity to qualify as an admin. Secondly and much more serious in my opinion is the way the user has let other editors defend him during this RfA instead of giving clean answers to editors who questioned his actions. 's disappearance after the initial nomination also leaves me with doubts. Thus I oppose to this user not due to his merit or lack of as an editor but by the way he has reacted and by the events that lead to this RfA. Will likely support in case he is nominated once more in the future. 
oppose,While I initially had never heard of this user as I have never edied any Islam related subjects because it is not where my interests or expertise lies I find the possibility of having an administrator with a bias over a highly controversial subject to be upsetting. While everyone has a bias about something some are more or less likely to ever result in any kind of rising of tempers. I also have never considered the fact that someone has contributed a lot to Wikipedia to be grounds for being an Admin. 
oppose,Even though I feel that someday he'd make a fine administrator at this time I do not feel comfortable supporting an administrator who is involved in an ongoing dispute has unresolved issues with other users and has such a confrontational style. 
oppose,Not enough edits. 
oppose,Devious editor If you look at his edit trail he is totally intolerant of other POVs. Not Neutral in any sense of the word.
oppose,the "[[jury]] is still out" not enough is known about this user to justify an admin position. 
oppose,I agree that he's made some good contributions but from what I've seen of him in discussions he doesn't seem to deal with others well enough to justify adminship. I think he deserves acknowledgement for his contributions but not with an adminship. 
oppose,oppose. not enough edits. Seems to be in dispute with others. Admin nomination is no way to end disputes. 
oppose,Too confrontational. 
oppose,until ongoing conflicts are (at least partially) resolved. 
oppose,Strong Oppose Constantly engages in content wars with other editors on islamic topics. Users has a 'very very very strong proIslam POV (He's a recent convert to Islam) that he can't seem to disengage from. 
oppose,Too controversal. 
oppose,Mild Oppose for now. I see potential in BYT as an admin but he's still a bit rough around the edges. It's been less than 2 weeks since this business with his User page started and by his own admission he put the materials there because of his unfamiliarity w/ the logistics of WP. This isn't a bad thing but it's not a good thing for an admin especially when Ed's rationale is so that BYT can do everything he (Ed) can. In addition while BYT has been exceptionally diplomatic here this has not always been the case in his discussions with other users on various talk pages where he has sometimes been openly confrontational. Finally I am somewhat concerned by what I regard as his possibly dubious grasp of NPOV on issues close to his heart. (The thing that bothers me the most is the ongoing "lone wolf" business at [[Terrorism]]...but this isn't really the appropriate place to air laundry.) That said I am confident that some work on this along with another couple months of quality editing will change my "mild oppose" to "strong support". 
oppose,I've witnessed how he handles disputes and i'm not particularily impressed. Definite POV problems that can been seen in his User Page. 
oppose,I cannot support a candidate who has been the cause of several revert wars in sensitive articles. For example [[terrorism]]. 
oppose,A decent editor but controversial. I have not been in any confrontations with this user. 
oppose,He's been here since midMarch and has made fifty edits (including five here) all of beginnerlevel quality at best some approaching vandalism (such as simply adding his signature to articles). I'm also a little worried by the fact that in nominating himself BugzPal deleted all the other nominations and selfnominations and failed to notice or correct the mistake. It's difficult to believe that this is a serious selfnomination. 
oppose,It should be noted that BugzPal didn't delete all the other nominations. did <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_adminship&diff=12924878&oldid=12924810>. However the way he added his selfnomination back on doesn't really show that he is aware of vandalism when he sees it nor can he follow directions <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_adminship&diff=12925064&oldid=12924878>. 
oppose,Oppose. Only 50 or so edits and one of them was incorrectly adding April 29 information to the [[April 28]] page. 
oppose,Oppose. <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Old_96_District&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=12923917 This diff> shows BugzPal plagiarizing <http://www.sctravelold96.com/BC8CF48EEC774488BCA020B16146F025.asp this web page>.Be less bold BugzPal much less bold. 
oppose,from going through his contributions it seems he went through [[Wikipedia:Most wanted articles]] and placed copyvio material on every article he created not exactly desirable behavior from an admin 
oppose,What everyone else said and didn't format this RFA correctly... 
oppose,Oppose. 
oppose,Strong oppose for plagerism and lack of experience. 
oppose,needs to make more positive contributions and to gain more experience. 
oppose,Too few edits. 
oppose,Strong oppose not enough experience and posted numerous copyvio materials. Also nomination was misplaced as it isn't a selfnomination. 
oppose,for the same reasons as everyone else. I'm also concerned that the only supporter the anon appears to have a pattern of edits simular to BugzPal. 
oppose,Strong oppose I normaly vote support and don't think edit counts are important but 50 is way too few. Also I like to see admins doing janitorial work this user has done none. 
oppose,Definitely oppose since he couldn't even be bothered to answer the questions below. 
oppose,Mega oppose I wouldn't want to beat a dead horse so see above comments.oo64eva (Alex) (
oppose,User has no user page. 
oppose,Normally I don't vote but this user only has 38 edits no user page and I think that it's too early. 
support,Let me be the first to support this fine editor. 
support,Bushytails would make a great addition to the Wiki team 
support,I don't believe this user would abuse admin tools. 
support,If Phroziac nominated that's already a huge plus she's a well respected editor. That plus a quick scan of your contribs (alot of vandal reverts and edit summaries ol' [[user:Durin|Durin]] would be proud) and I think Bushy definately deserves the mop. Edits be damned.

support,Enthusiastic Bushytails is one of the best things about Wikipedia. 
support,what another dildo among friends? Seriously folks tackling a subject like that is decidedly not easy and deserves some recognition. Beyond that sometimes it seems we're entirely too hard on people. 
support,What's wrong with strapon dildos? 
support,will make a good admin. 
support,lots of good quality writing and reasoned responses to the arguments against that DYK entry. Would make a good admin IMO. 
support,What's wrong with dildoes? 
support,[[User talk:Hipocrite|&laquo;Talk&raquo;]] 16:54 31 October 2005 (UTC) Nothing wrong with a good dildo. 
support,Don't really understand the Oppose votes. I can't see how any of this makes him unlikely to be a good admin. 
support,To some of the oppose voters: Please stop treating adminship as some prize to hand out to people you like. It's about whether the candidate is willing and able to use administrative privileges. If you disagree with Bushytails on whether the Wikipedia Main Page should be "familyfriendly" or not discuss it with him. An adminship nomination is not the place for that discussion. The concerns that the user may abuse their privileges based on this incident are farfetched at best and in any case almost any damage is easily undone. Expressing a controversial opinion should not be grounds for denying a user adminship; indeed courageously and honestly speaking one's mind (while making an effort not to be hurtful) should be rewarded.
oppose,In regard to the strap on dildo comment I question the maturity of this user. 
oppose,<http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AMain_Page&diff=25759766&oldid=25759113 this comment> suggests that the user doesn't appreciate the need for "sound editorial judgement"<http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikienl/2005August/027352.html> in some matters. 
oppose,Weak Oppose. Although I largely agree with him on the substance of the Dildo discussion (and find the article itself rather good though more detailed than i can bear) I think he has dealt with the controversy in a rather undiplomatic way. Reactions to the criticism with comments such as "this really made me laugh out loud" and then ignoring the content of the criticism does not make one level headed or cool. Instead it makes you look arrogant and only serves to enrage others more. Remember [[m:Don't be a dick|dont be a Cock]] ;) 
oppose,agree with Snowflake. 
oppose,per . I edit from work and I know many others do as well. I have concerns about this editor's judgement.
oppose,unfortunately; seems like a nice guy. [[Strapon dildo]] reads like a [[WP:NOT#Wikipedia is not an instruction manual|howto]] (indeed Bushytails refers to it as a "guide") and is a bad example of non[[WP:NPOV|NPOV]]. It's not a bad place for an article to start but I'd like an admin to be a little more familiar with applying those policies. 
oppose,Weak Oppose per Scimitar. I think Bushytails is a fine contributor but I am sensitive to others' concerns. This is really a "bettersafethansorry" vote; I'd like more of a record to evaluate his judgment in light of the concerns raised here. 
oppose,per antidildoism above and 1400 edits isn't that many. It would have been if the candidate is able to appear level headed and sensible but the dildo stuff makes me think that this is not the case. 
oppose,it is not a "fallacy" to express the view that the main page should be worksafe it's an understandable concern. 
oppose,due to maturity concerns and a very low edit count. 
oppose,Per the many reasons already given. Sorry. 
oppose,also stemming from the DYK Strapon incident. See below under Comments. 
oppose,insufficent edits insufficent experience no understanding of [[WP:NOT]]. 
oppose,EXTREME OPPOSE Extremely immature oppiniatedtothepointofneglectingeveryoneelse'sopinion defensive agumentative mean makes personal attacks allows swearing on his articles & allows gross links too. Will never change my opinion. Thanks.... 
oppose,Analytically opposed After reviewing a few edits and his profile I find his maturity and objectivity absolutely in question. Not to mention his odd animal fetish seems borderline pathological. 
oppose,Object I don't think he demonstrates enough tact to be an admin. 
support,Most users below brought friends into mix over Veganism article dispute. (Note I have been using wiki for a long time however anon. through NAU libraries.) Figured I would through in my support for someone not part of the wiki elite. 10:28 5 December 2005 (UTC) (User's [[Special:Contributions/redpatcher|first edit]] 
oppose,User just violated [[WP:3RR|3RR]] today in the article [[Veganism]] (see <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Veganism&diff=30204443&oldid=30203158> <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Veganism&diff=prev&oldid=30201442> <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Veganism&diff=prev&oldid=30199701> <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Veganism&diff=prev&oldid=30190139>) showed extremely belligerent attitude in the ensuing edit war leaving edit summaries like "Fixing the ignorance of Idleguy" while blanking whole sections. With this attitude I don't think the user is ready/suitable for adminship. 
oppose,He's actually close to a block for harrassing and got general uncivility on the [[Veganism]] article. I have a feeling he wants to become an admin for the wrong reasons. 
oppose,He has actively sought to edit articles and remove large sections which are clearly cited with sources and has been very negative on me as stated by above admins. I would not want to see him as admin anytime soon. 
oppose,In addition to harassing [[Idleguy]] he has harassed me for making changes to [[Veganism]] that violate his POV. He uses multiple IPs to the point of sockpuppetry and in general has a negative and taunting attitude. He edits in bad faith and has a complete misunderstanding of NPOV. 
oppose,Clear oppose. [[Image:Flag_of_Europe_and_Austria.svg|20px]] 
oppose,as per all of above.
oppose,essentially asserts that he will use admin powers in his own conflicts. 
oppose,for reasons cited above. 
oppose,should not use admin powers in own disputes. Willing to change vote next time.
oppose,less than 500 edits despite almost a year in Wikipedia. And reasons stated above. 
oppose,"Close to a block" and "admin candidate" in the same sentence doesn't sit well with me. 
oppose,Low ammounts of edits very low use of User talk need more interaction. Your contributions to Wikipedia (of) which you are particularly pleased article below is a [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Red Link Recovery|Red Link]] 
oppose,all of the above 
oppose,not convinced that user would make a good admin 
oppose,only a small (<500) number of edits. 
oppose,User fails to endow reasonable confidence for correct behavior as admin. 
oppose,gave the wrong answers to the RfAd questions (I didn't even realize that was possible!) 
oppose,Strong Oppose Somebody call a bureaucrat to close this already. Everything I think has already been said above. 
oppose,Answers to questions...seem...questionable. As per Woohookitty (below). 
support,been around a looooooooooooong time 
support,meets . Just because he won't be able to allocate as much time to the project doesn't mean he'll stop. He looks a responsible user and won't use his powers badly if slightly more infrequntly. No reason in my mind to oppose. Good luck! 
support,good candidate. The nominator's newness should not reflect on him and he has both the number of edits and the time here required by most people's standards.
support,Meets . 
support,His answers are well considered and have the ring of truth. 
support,no reason to oppose. 
support,I'm having a hard time finding any reason to oppose. Limited involvement once school starts should not be held against you. There are over 400+ admins most of them active. If you can only come on once in a while that's fine.Wikipedia will not lose anything if this user becames an admin.
oppose,reluctantly. I think this nominee's heart is in the right place and is a good candidate except...more than 60% of the nominee's edits were done on 10 days. 10. Ok maybe he is contributing huge amounts in single edits. That's certainly possible. There's also the note below in his answer to question 1 where he says he available time to work on Wikipedia will go down as he starts grad school. I have real concerns about a lack of day to day week to week involvement in Wikipedia that he would most likely have as an admin. I would like to see the nominee clarify just what his level of commitment to being an admin is and whether he truly thinks he will have time to wield the mop. If adequate explanations are forthcoming I would consider changing my vote. 
oppose,I don't do rigid guidelines on RfA and I prefer quality over the various quantities. But there isn't enough experience in Wikipedia: space and Talk: space and the like and given the length of time that's really not so many edits the graph also shows rather sporadic participation. And while we have the rather unfortunate nominations process the nominator might give some consideration to offering that kind of nomination although it is not among the reasons for my opposition. 
oppose,agreeing with the above. Lack of experience in Wikispace. 
oppose,the second edit of his which I checked was an error (marked as minor) which I had to fix: compare <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Drag&diff=prev&oldid=21849469 his diff> and <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Drag&diff=22142923&oldid=21849469 my diff>. If it wasn't made by an admin nominee I'd be thinking about issuing a vandalism warning. Three isn't two! 
support,hereby given. 
support,Seems to be a friendly and helpful contributor. 
support,Seems a good contributor. 
support,Sorry I forgot to log in. 
support,Strong for his contributions as a voice of reason on VfD as well as considerable contribution to the PAC in which he's expanded some 20+ stubs into full article status. I'm not sure I understand the logic of the opposition here: I guess a hypothetical ideal admin candidate would be active in all parts of WP and familiar with every possible duty but most wikipedians (even the best ones) find their niche instead and do what they do best. Celestianpower has already found that niche for himself and he's a damn fine contributor. 
support,Strong Per Starblind. By the way you meet your criteria. 
support,2000 edits in 4 months low? Good grief. The only reason I have a lot of edits for my time here is because I spend like 10 hours a day at this place... 
support,see no indication he would misuse admin powers. 
support,Once again I thought you were an admin already. 
support,I agree with Starblind. 
support,Celestianpower certainly tries to be helpful although they aren't always technically able to answer my questions. 
support,Pretty much any editor meeting my criteria gets my vote but I think this lad shows a lot of promise. Someone needs to deal with all the Pokecruft but I'd like to see what else he has up his sleeve. 
support,I think Starblind puts it best. He is a good contributor particularly with his activeness in [[WP:PAC]]. I think he would use his admin powers well. 
support,adminship is no big deal. Someone who only does a few admin tasks is better than someone who can't do any at all. 
oppose,CP seems like a worthwhile user but his contributions are rather onesided and he doesn't seem overly interested in cleanup or maintenance work. Good candidate for a barnstar but not for a mop. 
oppose,Seems pleasant and a worthwhile contributor to certain areas but I share concerns about overspecialization in his contributions and am also concerned about the tentative language regarding the closure of VfD's and the banning of IP addresses. Both of these tasks are key ones performed by admins and this user does not appear ready to assume the responsibility that goes with making tough decisions about deleting and banning. 
oppose,regretfully. There isn't anything "wrong" with you please understand that. However administrators are heavily expected to get down and dirty especially in the case of vandalism patrol. I feel that you're not sure enough of yourself to handle this at this moment. I suggest going to [[WP:CDVF]] and do some vandalism patrol work. You might find it not at all difficult. If you're not elected administrator come back after "expanding your horizons" a bit and then reapply. You're a good editor so keep it up | [[User_talk:Linuxbeak|Talk]] | 
oppose,More time wider experience. 
oppose,More time. 
oppose,Too soon. 
oppose,per Aaron Brenneman Variable and The Jps. 
support,We need people like to help combat certain systemic bias on Wikipedia. 
support,I've rarely worked with Chamaeleon but from what I've seen I'd class him as the best editor I've come across. Especially commendable is the way he has dealt with while working on [[Noam Chomsky]]?
support,there's plenty of POVwarriors on wikipedia and we need more people like Chamaeleon to counter that.> <http://www.revolutionaryleft.com Revolutionary Left> | 
support,good editor adds valuable skills to Wikipedia. 
support,I would trust Chamaeleon not to abuse admin privileges. I think this is probably a similar case to Jayjg who can be a bit contentious at times as an editor but is a very evenhanded admin (actually since becoming an admins he's mellowed a bit as an editor. I suspect the same would happen here). BTW unmentioned by any of the above is that Chamaeleon is a very multilingual contributor and a real goto guy for difficult work involving Spanish or French language. 
support,Wikipedia needs translators. Same as Jmabel I trust Chamaelon not to abuse admin privileges. 
support,being opinionated doesn't mean he isn't fair and can't distinguish his own POV. 
support,Gotta love [[Domestic AC power plugs & sockets]]. 
oppose,Chamaleon mentions that he would like to act as a mediator for disputes. However his edit summaries reveal a rather abrasive editing style. Examples: "No offence but only idiots think that reductio ad absurdum means a "silly conclusion..." <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Noam_Chomsky&diff=prev&oldid=10829830> "Who but rightwing POV warriors trying to score points wants the long version?" <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Antiglobalization&diff=prev&oldid=11800844> "are you all illiterate?" <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=New_antiSemitism&diff=prev&oldid=11613313>. Admin must often interact with other editors and I'd like to see candidates be a bit more restrained. 
oppose,The edit summaries mentioned by Carbonite are too recent to be ignored. . 
oppose,User is too distracted by his visions of "rightwing POV warriors" "American bigotry" <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Chameleon&oldid=8235100> and "Yank spellings" <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Mineral&diff=6357464&oldid=6290301> to mediate conflict or perform sysop duties effectively and without bias. 
oppose,His previous departure came after being inappropriately blocked by his opponent in an edit war as I recall (before 3RR enforcement was adopted) and certainly had as much to do with that as with any criticism Chamaeleon received. The reaction is understandable and shouldn't be held against him. His overall temperament is not presently wellsuited for adminship however and his responses in this debate aren't necessarily helping his cause. 
oppose,Does not appear to have a good grasp of policy particularly [[WP:NPOV]] and [[Wikipedia:No original research]]. Has on a number of occasions deleted properly cited content and/or inserted original research in its stead on political grounds and then edit warred to maintain his deletions/original research in an extremely combative way without any apparent recognition of the need to respect Wikipedia policy. Not tempermentally suited to adminship. 
oppose,reluctantly. Edits like <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Noam_Chomsky&diff=11146176&oldid=11145630 this one> (there are others) show an understanding of NPOV which is radically different to [[WP:NPOV]]. 
oppose,Seems like a good editor but I have to agree with . 
oppose,A good contributor overall but I really don't like the insults especially recently. 
oppose,generally a good editor polyglots are always useful but unfortunatly I cannot support someone who makes the comments he has. I will support next time if he mellows his language somewhat. 
oppose,seems to be a valuable contributor not to mention the great eyelashes; however the pattern of abrasive insulting interactions with other editors makes Chamaeleon an unsuitable candidate for admin. 
oppose,. Strong oppose. He seems not to have understood [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view]] or [[Wikipedia:No original research]] and takes POVpushing to extremes. He wrote today that: "I have never seen a statement from the ADL ([[AntiDefamation League]]) condemning antiSemitism only ones condemning leftists" which is absurd. <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANew_antiSemitism&diff=11844891&oldid=11844857> I'm also opposing because of his combative responses to other oppose votes. People should be allowed to vote as they see fit without being challenged by the nominee. And I'm not keen on his sourgrapesinadvance comment underneath his nomination. <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_adminship%2FChamaeleon&diff=11845905&oldid=11845827> 
oppose,Unquestionably a very valuable editor but perhaps a little bit too jumpy for an administrator right now. Since according to some "adminship should not be a big deal" I would like my opposition to be seen as a suggestion that some more time of practice of negociations and editing in troubled waters will be usefull for Chamaeleon to come to a more serene state of mind. I am confident that the "misunderstanding of the NPOV policy" will face away with a growing peace of mind. 
oppose,Oppose and I am considering an RfC based on actions like "<http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Antiglobalization_and_AntiSemitism&diff=11874371&oldid=11874269 this> pages like and statements like "I suggest you go take your pills". (
oppose,the main thing that I would do differently if made an admin is to act as more of a mediator rather than a participant when there are disputes. I have no idea how Chamaeleon is as an editor but from reading his responses here I can see how he'll be as a mediator. 
oppose,Oppose. <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ANew_antiSemitism&diff=11856396&oldid=11855108 "Um all the Jews in their big conspiracy"> An 'ironic' statement indeed. Ironic that the VfD he spearheaded against new antisemitism utterly failed. As a leftwing POV warrior himself I am not suprised he hates rightwing POV warriors.<!oppose oppose oppose! > His atrocious attitude displayed in this RfA and elsewhere (including apple pie edit warring lameorama) clearly signals the further damage he could do if given the blocking/page protection "mop and bucket". Will reconsider at the [[heat death of the universe]]. 
oppose,he seems to spin guidelines to suit his POV. I doubt he understands NOR as anything but a weapon.
oppose,The thought of such a user with admin powers makes me shiver uncontrollably. 
oppose,Emphatically oppose. Adminship is supposed to be no big deal. I fear that granting it to a user like Chameleon would MAKE it VERY big deal as it would hand him the tools to do more easily what he already does far too much of edit warring and reverting with his POV. His nottoosubtle antisemitism doesn't endear him to me either. 
oppose,Strongly Oppose.←
oppose,Too confrontational to be a mediator and his political position though not always completely coherent is too prominent in his editing and interactions with other editors. 
oppose,Chamaeleon states on this page that (s)he wants to be a wikisoldier. We've had wikiwarriors before. Didn't work out. Most have left now. Don't need/want new ones.See also: [[m:WikipediAhimsa]]. Say 100 and try again in 3 months or so. 
oppose,I would vote yes but I really do not like the talks about warriors above. Wiki should stay encyclopedia not become battlefield. Recent comment <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith/Vote&diff=prev&oldid=10586064> says about problem with keeping trail (I don't mind language but links are missing). Some edits lack summary. 22:10 3 Apr 2005 (UTC) <br>Reading links above I changed my mind to oppose. Powerplays would destroy Wikipedia as it is now. (The solution to trolls is to have better technical infrastructure for contributors IMO). 
oppose,I actually didn't plan to vote on this but followed the discussion nevertheless. However I've come upon several messages sent by Chamaeleon to other people (for instance [[User talk:Tothebarricades.tk]] section Solidarity; also Che y Marijuana's talk page) whose sole purpose is to circumwent the 3R rule. I find such a behaviour very unethical and not worthy of an admin. Therefore I decided to take part in this vote. 
oppose,Um no. 
oppose,Not yet. Maybe in six months or so. 
oppose,I admire people who "test the waters" but only if they have some fighting chance. Because Chanting Fox has only been with us for a month this user has no chance now. Come back when you have more experience. 
oppose,for now. keep up the hard work and try again in a few months. 
oppose,I've noticed your RCpatrolling but you need to get much more overall experience in simple editing and how stuff works on WP (knowing how to make a redirect is a really really basic thing that I read on your talk page that you don't know how to do yet.) Try again in 2 months. 
oppose,Come back in a few months when you have substantially more experience. 
oppose,Impressive edit count for being here a month but just too new. Good to see someone interested in fighting vandalism though and I'd probably support after a few more months of similar activity. 
support,Lot of help with vandals. You may sometimes put <nowiki>{{testX}}</nowiki> on their Talk pages to establish track for the future. 
support,Pretty much what Pavel said. I've been doing some RC patrol lately (well within the last month) and CF has been fixing stuff before I can get to it on several occasions. Give the man his mop [[{{ns:2}}:Clawson|chris.lawson]](
support,Taking a little time off from my Wikibreak to support an excellent vandal hunter. 
support,An exceptionally great newcomer when he just went here and started quality vandalism reverts. He'll make a great admin here on Wikipedia. A rollback feature may give him some more convenience! 
support,He may only have about 1800 edits but they were quality edits. We really should judge people based on their edits not the number. 
oppose,He reverts and calls edits vandalism too quickly without thiking and without even bother to reply to queries about his revert left on his talkpage. He reverted a NPOV edit on a temporary article page calling it vandalism (http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Mel_Etitis/JTF&diff=18109860&oldid=18109796) 4 July 2005 04:44 (UTC) 
oppose,Oppose. You're not ready for adminship as you've only been here for just under three out of nine months. 
oppose,I'm not much for editcountitis but you're below the fourdigit mark. Also don't bite the [[user:Fishpaste|newbies]]. 
oppose,I disagree that you haven't been here long enough but some of your actions have shown an unfortunate lack of grace and tact. Give it a month or two and I may change my vote. 
oppose,Below 1000 edits on articles (at the time of nomination) and hasn't edited for enough of his time here. Also didn't sign his nomination which isn't impressive. 
oppose,Not enough experience and has made a few poor judgement calls. 
oppose,Not wellrounded: only reverts vandalism. Doesn't seem to understand the wikipedia interface or protocols judging by his selfnomination "speech". Seems to have good intentions but not yet trustworthy... 
oppose,Needs more time here. 1000 edits isn't enough. 
oppose,Oppose. Please come back later. 
oppose,Oppose. for now. Bit too green. 
oppose,Sorry to have missed my chance to oppose him. Could someone alert me if he renominates himself any time soon? Chanting Fox try doing more work on articles and read the article on [[Wikipedia:Assume good faith|assuming good faith]]. Make it your credo and I'd change my vote. 
oppose,don't want to surface editcountitis but 113 edits is VERY little if you've got more edits on other Wikis why not try there? Also failure to answer questions. 
oppose,Per NSLE but let's not start a pileup okay?
oppose,per NSLE keep up the editing and try again in a few months. 
oppose,per NSLE. 
oppose,STRONG Oppose user is simply way too green as said above if you have so much experience with other wiki's why not ask for adminship there? I strongly suggest you bow out now and renominate in 6 months. 
oppose,email is not set. 
support,Allow me to be the first. Editcountitus is teh sux and the one who invented the editcounter realizes this. Did Kate post that message for no reason? Did she convince no one? Because he is under 2000 (Angela made it with 68 and I guess she's an alright editor...) does it mean he'll abuse the tools? I trust that he'll ask when he's not sure what to do. The only reason to oppose someone based on edit count would be in the unlikely possibility that they could be some troll and looking at Chowells edits he must be one damn good actor if he is one ;) [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,Cautious support per Redwolf.~ 
support,with no reservations I trust Chowells very much. 
support,No reason to believe this candidate would abuse admin tools. 
support,I've seen good work and edit counts aren't the be all end all. 
support,From zero to hero. [[Wikipedia:Are_You_a_Wikipediholic_Test|Are you a wikiholic]]? 
support,Chowells removes a lot of vandalism. As an admin Chowells could use rollback + ban users that keep vandalising. 
support,Tentative I would have recommended beforehand waiting a couple of months before selfnominating though I have nothing against this editor's nomination at this moment in time. 
support,I checked and he is good vandal fighter which is an evergrowing problem. I think we nedd lots of them No problems.
support,Strong Major bonus that he created articles from stratch I do that myself alot and it takes a ton of work and energy to learn a topic well enough to make a decent page his time on Wikipedai isn't a problem way past 3 months and usually the edit count is extremely overemphasized by the voters so that doesn't matter to me as long as he has over 500. 
support,Strong la! Prolific against vandals and overall good contributions. I'm sure he'll make a great admin! 
support,no reason not to. 
support,[[WP:ESP|e]]
support,[[Image:Symbol support vote.svg|15px]] . 
support,Good range of articles nice use of edit summaries and POV fighting starts new articles. 
support,( 
support,I sure could do with some help on the vandalism IRC channel... [[user:Celestianpower|Cel]][[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,According to Raul654 we only have about 1020 people on RC patrol at any time. This user is active on RC patrol. 1020 people to control 37 billion edits per second is not enough. 
support,support 
support,Decent guy no reason not to support. 
oppose,too soon. 
oppose,only 4 weeks real activity no matter how intensive is not enough. 
oppose,Spend some time contributing in the WP namespace. Come back in a month or two and I will support. 
oppose,He is not ready yet. Mayebe in the future. 
oppose,Sorry too soon. 
oppose,Sorry too soon. 
oppose,4 weeks real activity is significantly too short. It may feel like you'll be ok by then but there's just stuff that happens that it takes a bit longer than that to pick up on. Even after the threemonth golden line there's plenty to learn (trust me!). I would also like to see more Wikipeda: and related space edits. Editcountitis is only teh sux when you merely think "oh he's below Xthousand". Looking at edit count numerics is simply asking that a user have more experience of pressing save having to live with the consequences and being able to patch things up when they make a mistake. This is particularly true in Wikipedia: space where conflicts too often flare up. Keep up the good work for a couple more sets of 4weeks and I'm sure you'll be fine. You'll be surprised at how much more you learn between now and then. 
oppose,Sorry but I think you're still too inexperienced. 
oppose,For the reasons listed above. 
oppose,Weak oppose seems like a good editor but has been active on Wikipedia for too little time. 
oppose,per Splash. 
oppose,Splash says it well. 
oppose,per Splash. 
support,blah blah editcountitis is bad speak to him on IRC blah teh bestes extreme lesbians [[WP:Editcountitis]] blah 
oppose,While you've been here for almost <http://tools.wikimedia.de/~kate/cgibin/count_edits?dbname=enwiki&user=CJS102793 one year> you only have five edits in the Wikipedia namespace not related to this RFA. Adminship requires a substantial degree of community involvement so I'm obliged to oppose. Come back when you have had more experience dealing with other users. 
oppose,Per Titoxd. Plus you show very little use of edit summaries which makes it problemmatic for RC patrol. Give yourself another couple months to become more involved and try again.
oppose,Oppose. Please use edit summaries when you contribute and the preview button. All that is making it easier for other people to understand your contributions. Remember you are not alone in here. 
oppose,Please consider contributing more to wikipedia before reapplying. Several other users have posted [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Standards|unofficial standards]] they consider will qualify potential admin candidates. Although this is unofficial this is a good guideline of what will qualify you in many users' eyes 
oppose,I concur with other above. Limited Project edits and no usertalk edits will cause many to oppose. 
oppose,since I can't say per above I won't say anything at all since I can't give more advice than what's already given. 
oppose,indeed being here a year doesn't count for anything. You'll need to get more involved with the Project and community side of things. 
oppose,lack of edit summaries not a large history of vandal fighting vs your fighting vanadlism reason. 
oppose,Should be more active take more time to familiarize her/himself with Wikipedia then try again. [[Image:Flag of Austria.svg|15px]] 
oppose,I know editcount isn't everything but you've got under 150 edits in total with virtually none of them being in the Wikipedia namespace (i.e. very little community involvement). You really need to be involved in the community side of Wikipedia to have the necessary understanding of the beast to be an administrator of it. I'd advise you to have a look at the standards that some of the more frequent RfA voters suggest a potential candidate needs [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Standards|here]]. 
support,Strong His dedication to the project has demostrated without a doubt that he is an asset to Wikipedia. Besides he's a hell of a nice guy. 
support,he meets so long as you commit to using edit summaries. You seem like a very nice guy. 
support,Definitely!!! 
support,good editor solid contributor. 
support,seems like a good editor. 
support,even if you did use caps in anger. ;) 
support,I see no reason against this candidate but providing edit summaries would be much better.
oppose,After a little more research I noticed you rarely use edit summaries and lack edits in the Wikipedia and User Talk namespaces. Leaving a summary helps out the RC Patrollers use that they don't have to check if you are vandalizing an article. Few Wikipedia and User Talk edits indicate lack of adminesque work and lack of communication respectively. I'll support in the future provided you expand your horizons beyond just writing articles. [[User Talk:Acetic Acid|Acetic]]
oppose,Toward the end of the naming dispute at [[Talk:Guns N' Roses]] you began "yelling" and excessive criticism of a revertwarrer. He deserved it I admit but an admin needs to tread softly in every situation. 
oppose,Lack of edit summaries is problematic; uses them 21% overall 32% in the last 300 edits. I prefer seeing >80% minimum in an admin nominee. Participation has increased since joining Wikipedia but average edit count is 5.4 per day for all days 7.6 for contributing days over the last month. I prefer see >10 edits per day average for an admin nominee. The dispute noted by wasn't too bad but throws up a tiny red flag. Participation outside of Article/User name spaces is 15% of total edits. Not a really low percentage but slightly low. 
oppose,need more nonarticle edits.
support,18:09 27 October 2005 (UTC) Nominees may not vote for themselves. 
oppose,I've added here because this seems to have been set up without the use of the normal template. I oppose creating admins who are on a POV mission regardless of whether it's right or wrong. And I have little doubt about which category this user falls into. 
oppose,The inclusion of gross incivility bordering on personal attacks in this candidate's own selfnomination does not bode well. Stated intent to be trigger happy with blocking is of concern. Likely to violate LaRouche ArbCom decision too. 
oppose,an administrator's function is not to go out to block other administrators or to have an agenda against them and the [[WP:NPA|personal attacks]] written above leave me with quite a bad impression of the user. 
oppose,Per all of the above plus you voted for yourself. [[WP:ESP|e]]
oppose,per above and from past exposure to Cognition's POV pushing and bizarrely unhelpful edits. 
oppose,I'm not sure if this RfA will get off the ground but it's not even necessary to look outside this page for evidence of unsuitability as an admin. The personal attacks and accusations against other editors in the nomination leave me baffled. 
oppose,per reasons mentioned above. Relatively low edit count as well. 
oppose,Wikipedia:Requests for adminship is not a missile silo for personal attacks. 
oppose,Wikipedia propaganda free? What about [[Wikipedia:List of drugfree Wikipedians]]? 
oppose,I could swing either way on this one. Let's see ... joined Wikipedia to promote [[Lyndon LaRouche]] has no understanding of [[WP:NOR]] [[WP:NPOV]] or [[WP:V]] has been blocked seven times in two months has caused multiple pages to be protected is abusive to other editors engages in [[WP:POINT]] believes the Beatles worked for British intelligence and that the Queen is a dopepusher. <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Cognition&oldid=18183135> Yikes I can't decide. for now. 
oppose,My sources tell me the temperature in hell is still unseasonably warm. 
oppose,Oppose not admin material. 
oppose,per above and what the hell you voted for yourself!? 
oppose,This is the most illconceived RFA I could have imagined. One thing I will never understand: Pete Camejo? I mean Pete Camejo! Really [[Peter Camejo|PETE CAMEJO]] is a fascist?! 
oppose,What's so bad about H.G. Wells anyway?
oppose,Description includes inflammatory statements and answer to question 1 makes me concerned about impulsive reactions. Motivation for nomination seems to be retaliation at current admins. I do not trust this user to administer fairly on Wikipedia. 
oppose,In my personal dealings with him I have found Cognition to be reasonable and open to argument so I truly like him. However he has an undeniable record of questionable and troublesome edits so I must oppose. Also voting for oneself is bad form. 
oppose,per TenOfAllTrades and Xoloz. 
oppose,based on the above... looks like this entry deserves an early removal to stop the pileon. 
oppose,Comeuppance? 
oppose,but I'd be all about blocking Cognition. 
oppose,Strong only 286 edits. 
oppose,Oppose for now too few edits imo. Would make a fine admin of the future though. 
oppose,Opppose "Most of the work that I have done on Wikipedia is actually more in the line of administrative duties such as reverting vandalism NPOV disputes etc. Also I am more involved in making minor corrections such as syntax and POV fixes than in the creation of new articles and major content additions" These things can be done as a regular user. Until you prove yourself with more articles and edits I cannot support you. 
oppose,for now. You need to edit more. 
oppose,for now but user knows what (s)he doing and is on the right track. 
oppose,not enough edits. 
oppose,SEVEN DAYS AFTER bored a lot please support my nomination don't believe that I am likely to abuse admin privileges voting for yourself. That's left me with a bad taste in my mouth.May the Force be with you! 
oppose,I'm uneasy about selfnoms who vote for themselves especially when the vote is deleted rather than struck out. The nonvoting instruction was only recently bolded to make it obvious and admins need to be aware of policies like this. 
oppose,Was neutral until vote got removed instead of struck out. 
oppose,user is still too green for adminship. 
oppose,as per Shreshth and Alkivar. 
oppose,I've had good experiences with this user. However I think he/she needs to follow our RfA policies and procedures more closely and respect the process. 
oppose,I'm pretty sure this is just a joke RfA. 
support,Good history of reverting vandalism. Good luck 
support,Hg + NaF + Ti + K2SO4 + Ag + C3H8 &rarr; extremely good work in my opinion. 
support,Anyone who can make someone be bothered to write that (eyes skyward) out must be worth adminship. I support. 
support,I trust you will be a proud and active mopholder. 
support,Cool. 
oppose,Frighteningly abrasive personality. 
oppose,A troll. 
oppose,Sorry. Learn how to use talkpages and I might change my mind. 
oppose,Not enough contributions considering how long Darrien has been a member. 
support,How could I nominate and not support? 
support,&lt;AOL!>
support,The borderline copyvio stuff is not good but I'll chalk it up to newbieness and since we're only now mentioning it I think it's fair to see if he jumps to clean it up quickly. (Sort of like a ministerial candidate fixing up tax liabilities ) 
support,The copyvio thing is not a big problem. See comments section. 
support,I'm satisfied that understands that posting copyvio stuff is a mistake and that he hasn't done that recently and won't do it again. Posting PD stuff is OK of course although I would advise to make liberal use of license tags and comments to make sure the origin of the material and its legal status is clear. 
support,I believe that the copyvio issue has been addressed and that Darwinek will make a good admin. 
support,This should be no big deal. 
oppose,I'm sure this editor is a very good user overall but I simply can't support an administrator whose contributions include copyright violations and posting public domain material without including the original source. [[Wikipedia:Copyright problems]] is bursting at the seams with listings and we should have administrators who fight against this problem not contribute to it. 
oppose,Maybe later. Efforts to improve underdeveloped areas of Wikipedia are laudable but "posting public domain material without including the original source" is [[plagiarism]]. Also I generally like to see more community involvement (including housekeeping) of prospective janitors. 
oppose,Concerned about copyvios especially in light of commments about failure to correct them by marking them as copyvios. Also the blanking of talk pages without archiving is not something I condone.
oppose,Agree with the above. Keep up the good work just not admin material yet. 
oppose,An admin must know the meaning of [[plagiarism]]. "Since now I will be citing my sources." Not good enough—go back and provide sources for text and images you've already uploaded. Clean up your own mistakes. Then come back here. 
oppose,Does not meet 
oppose,Both the Fenian Swine and Davetunney seem to just be getting started as editors. 
oppose,From his own talk page: I am a newbie when it comes to Wikipedia. He only started on 15 July and has less than 50 edits (from what I can see). If you stay here for a few more months and rack up about 700 edits (at least) you'll look a lot better. Also candidate hasn't accepted yet. 
oppose,Candidate has only 41 edits. Submitter has only 272. 
oppose,This does not seem to be a serious nomination. Any objection to removing it? 
oppose,Too new on WP to have built up editing experience. Maybe try at a later date? 
support,I have had good experience with this user. He says he will be more careful when he has permanent deletion powers and remember that nothing an admin does is "permanently permanent" anyway. His work on the [[Layla]] article really impressed me. He came in and picked up a piece to greatly improve it which he has <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Layla&diff=0&oldid=10485732> and I feel this is the sort of stuff that shows he is ready to be an admin. 
support,This should be no big deal. Benefit of the doubt. 
oppose,1000 is a bit low with just 4 months... A couple of improper speedy tags one of which is <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Seacrest%2C_Out&diff=prev&oldid=13687081 a gimme redirect> and the other of which <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Black_Hebrew_Israelites&diff=prev&oldid=13908252 was a bit POV but clearly not a speedy>. Just eyeballing it about 1/3 of the edits have no edit summary. Very sparse <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Deltabeignet&action=history talk page>. 
oppose,As of now only has <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3AContributions&target=Deltabeignet&hideminor=0&namespace=3 26 edits> to the user talk namespace. This does not show a sufficient amount of user interaction for an admin. 
oppose,regretfully. In my opinion selfnominations require an even more compelling case than other people's nominations and 1000 edits isn't that high. Give it a little more time and I'll change my vote. 
oppose,[[Image:Flag_of_Australia.svg|15px]] 
support,[[User talk:Y0u|(Y0ur talk page)]] [[Special:Contributions/Y0u|(Y0ur contributions)]] 16:28 July 18 2005 (UTC) I am concerned about the recent RfC and do see some communication problems (possibly in civility) so I change my vote slightly. [[User talk:Y0u|(Y0ur talk page)]] [[Special:Contributions/Y0u|(Y0ur contributions)]] 20:19 July 18 2005 (UTC) On another second thought while ths user may not be the best at interacting with others I can tell that the user tries hard to do so and I vote for admins based mostly on demonstrated good faith. I therefore change my degree of support. 
support,Has a lot of edits really helpful around Wikipedia and is a really great person. 
support,Appears to be a good active contributor to Wikipedia and has shown considerable commitment to the project and to the maintenance of articles. Valuable edits evidence of a wide range of contributions and evidence of some fair communication skills would show this person to be a valuable admin in the future. I notice that there are areas which this user could improve by his own admission and I would hope that this user would do so after receiving administrative privileges. 
support,The candidate's approach to issues which have been raised regarding his behavior has been quite positive. I am not refering to this RfA in specific but rather for example to when an user explained why he thought it was unfair that Denelson voted oppose when a candidate didn't meet his timebased adminship criterion. The answer you would expect from an average editor? "It's my rating system so screw you have a nice day". Denelson's response on the other hand was to change his opposes to neutrality from that point on. Good judgement will likely make a good admin. 
support,I'm voting in support because Denelson seems thoroughly dedicated to wikipedia. He has also addressed the problems raised in the RFC with the "wikimood" indicator. Also even though he takes negative comments too harshly he still heeds their meaning. 
support,It takes enormous skill to compensate for aspergers. As long as Denelson83 is capable of functioning more or less normally socially his other skills are likely to be utterly fantastic. Since adminship does require some social skill I think Denelson might take a little longer than average to learn to use the additional buttons (due to the social side effects). Aside from that a good pick by Pall here 
oppose,I feel thet s/he won't be as civil as wee'd like to see in an admin. 
oppose,as I'm concerned that everything taken into account there could still be serious interaction problems. You'll get far worse than you've had on your talk page so far if you become an active admin I'd have thought and just removing the comments isn't the way to go. If sensitivity to comments can be measured on a 21point scale that's too much sensitivity for me. The new policy box on the talk page was also added just after the posting of this RfA so is an ultrarecent change not yet tested in practise. I'm not too interested in the previous RfC since that's been addressed. 
oppose,I was thinking about ignoring my gut but this one's just too big of a feeling to pass up. I don't feel right about supporting and there's simply too much evidence to go neutral so I'm going to oppose. 
oppose,Quoted from the standard admin questions below: "On the RfC I expressed that I have an attribute of volatility. But I hope that I can keep that in check if I am given admin status." While this certainly shows an uncommon amount of honesty volatility is not an admirable quality to look for in an admin. Other points against include the user's bizarre talk page policykeeping paths of dialogue open is highly important for an admin in particular and that RfC isn't exactly ancient history. My advice: keep up the good work in article space lose the volatility encourage talkpage communication and come back when the RfC is ancient history. At the moment there's just too many negatives to seriously consider supporting this candidate. 
oppose,; his votes on other RFAs are based solely on the length the candidate's account has been active which to me indicates he has a tendency to generalize issues and overlook the nuance that's not a good quality for an admin. 
oppose,; General agreement with the case as stated by Starblind. 
oppose,Granted I haven't seen all of this user's RfA votes but the ones I have seen were based almost solely on longevity rather than on contributions dedication to making WP better or interaction with other users (except in the most obvious cases like DrZoidberg's last week). Also I'm a bit leery concerning the "Wikimood" promise as there would be little accountability for him to make sure that he only used admin powers at appropriate times. 
oppose,The removal of negative comments from your talk page is still a concern even with the stoppage of the behavior described in the RfC. Administrators can potentially run into a lot more abuse than other editors and describing yourself as "volatile" only leads me to believe that there will be problems in the future. Also administrators need to be transparent in their actions. Removing legitimate complaints from your talk page even if they are phrased in a nonfriendly manner will only muddy the waters when trying to figure out if administrative powers have been misused or abused. One shouldn't have to retrieve deleted comments from talk history in order to piece together a conversation or a dispute. I also echo Radiant's concerns about your longevitybased criterion for administrators. 
oppose,As per above. 
oppose,Strong oppose. <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Denelson83&direction=prev&oldid=19129019 This notice> on his talk page suggests to me that he's not ready for admin powers."I have considerable difficulty understanding the full substance of what other people say to me and I may have very prematurely interpreted your comment as negative demeaning and/or frightening and consequently removed your comment to help purge the bad feelings that it would cause me"??? If he can't 1) differentiate between neutral comments and neagative comments and 2) deal with negative comments then he doesn't need to be an admin. What happens when the block button is right there on the screen and it would be so easy to stop the negative comments by just blocking everybody that posts to the page? Or maybe it would be easier to just protect the page so nobody can contact him! This is an [[Wikipedia:Requests for Arbitration|RfAr]] waiting to happen; absolutely positively no way this user should be an admin. · [[User_talk:Essjay| Talk]] 17:20 July 21 2005 (UTC) .... later: It's been suggested that perhaps I was harsh in my comments; I would just like to clarify that I don't have any problem with mental illness particularly considering that I have [[Bipolar disorder|bipolar]]. The point is if his disability is going to interfere with his ability to accurately judge a situation then he doesn't need to be given the ability to abuse admin powers. His disability has no bearing on his adminship outide its relevance to his ability to effectively and properly use admin powers. I think his own comments demonstrate that he isn't s up to the job. 
oppose,Oppose. To take a fairly random example from 16 June (hardly over a month ago) <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Denelson83/Archive_page_4&amp;oldid=15304243 his/her user talk page> starts off by telling us "n.b. All past revisions of this page are considered to be deleted and may not be reviewed. Any attempt to influence my behaviour on Wikipedia using those past revisions will not be tolerated. To review past messages see the archive subpages." If this isn't tongue in cheek (and no evidence suggests to me that it is) then it strikes me as bizarre and pompously expressed to boot. (Oh and that precedes another warning.) When asked about this Denelson83 <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADenelson83%2FArchive_page_4&amp;diff=14598788&amp;oldid=14417955 simply deleted the question> which ended I'm just curious about how you claim that a record which is easily and freely available under the GFDL "may not be reviewed". Curiousity that's all. Feel free not to respond if you don't want to. While Denelson83 was within his/her right in deleting the message (on 29 May) this unwillingness to answer a question is not the sort of thing I look for in an administrator especially when the question is amicable and about an apparent misunderstanding of one aspect of the nature of this project. Denelson83 seems a good editor and in some ways an attractive candidate for administrator; but I'm not going to vote "support" until months (rather than mere weeks) after odd behavior such as attempting to dictate that past revisions of a page "may not be reviewed" compounded by refusal to explain this. 03:41 July 23 2005 (UTC) PS a comment prompted by Woohookitty's vote immediately below: I don't think anyone here has commented on Denelson83's deletion of anything from any talk page other than his/her own. In itself deleting stuff from one's own talk page is not a big no no. (Or I hope it isn't: on occasion I've deleted particularly inane comments from my own talk page.) But it's something that should be done exceptionally if at all: polite questions should in general be answered and politely so. 
oppose,Note to people who want to become admins. Do not say ANYWHERE that you can be volitile. Denelson you aren't a bad editor but deleting stuff from talk pages is a big no no. I'd stop doing it if I were you if you ever want to be an admin. 
oppose,No positive history with this user. Is also clearly desperate for adminship which is a bad thing. 
support,Guess I'll have to eh? | [[User talk:Flcelloguy|A note? ]]</font color>| 
support,Sure why not? 
support,Although I've only come across him via [[WP:MIND]] rather than on articles I've seen nothing that suggests to me he shouldn't be an admin. 
support,When I've come accross him he seems to be levelheaded and a good editor. 
support,Strong His help with me on [[Wikipedia:Barnstars on Wikipedia]] was above and beyond the call of duty. I'm going to vote for him 10 times but you don't have to count the last 9. ;) 
support,dedicated to the project. No reason in my mind that he wouldn't make a good admin. [[user:Celestianpower|Cel]][[WP:ESP|e]]
support,extreme support
support,He is very active and dedicated. 
support,Extreme Heterosexualist(sic) support. Did stupid things once in a while but he has always proven himself humble enough to apologize and learn from them. Has shown himself willing to listen to people's concerns rather than behaving stubbornly which IMHO should be the #1 criterion for adminship. 
support,Cooperative. 
oppose,I just don't believe this person would be a good admin from what I've seen. 
oppose,The " Me" signature smacks of campaigning which I find distateful. 
oppose,I generally hate to do this but all this campaigning isn't a good use of judgment in my opinion putting so much time in on [[WP:MIND]] when there's so many backlogs concerns me. I don't see much RC patrol/vandal fighting...I guess I'd like to see a broader particapation. Great energy and very positive though! 
oppose,I strongly dislike campaigning for adminship an editor that has earned the trust of the community and edited enough for the Wikipedia community to be aware of him or her should be able to pass RfA without campaigning and choosing to campaign when it should be unnecessary shows poor judgment (actually it was the user's campaigning that brought me to this vote page). Additionally the points brought up by the neutral and other opposing users give me further doubts about this request. 
oppose,still WAAAAAY too green in the political/user interaction aspect of the job of administrator. I dont know if this comes from his nonnative use of the english language or perhaps just inexperience in either case I dont feel this is the appropriate time to promote him... perhaps in a few months. 
oppose,I like your enthusiasm but think it's a little too early. You seem to act before reading the guidelines on what you're doing like with those FAC oppose votes that people have mentioned and I think that campaigning for support votes <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Deryck_Chan&oldid=24448393 this blatantly> was another example of this. I understand that you don't repeat your mistakes once they're pointed out and there's plenty in your favour eg going out of your way to welcome new people but I'd rather you spent a few more months on here before becoming an admin. 
oppose,Oppose for reasons already stated. I don't oppose campaigning but I don't like these complicated signatures. 
oppose,Please refer to my comments on the user's talk page. 
oppose,I can't say it better than was said by Juntung. The user's talk page is also revealing with it's quid pro quo dialogue with another admin candidate. 
oppose,I don't like the idea of campaigning. This isn't an election. [[User Talk:Acetic Acid|Ac]][[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]][[User Talk:Acetic Acid|tic]][[Special:Random|']]
support,Has tremendously improved various articles on local history transforming them from stubs to articles the WIkipedia can be proud of. Has more than enough experience to become an administrator. As to the objections a request to remove nonsense is appropriate certainly more appropriate than editwarring and is hardly an example of unsuitable temperament. Wikipedia is sufficiently complicated that there is no one who knows how everything works so thanking someone for helping him fix an image is hardly evidence that he shouldn't be an admin... 
support,Not many admins have been here for 1.5 years... no reason to oppose. 
support,No reason to oppose. 
oppose,Fewer than 1000 edits (although he has been here for 1.5 years) lacking some community involvement (about 10 edits on Wikipedia: namespace) don't see any vandal fighting and some edits like this <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Vardion&diff=9548753&oldid=9547298 unsigned demanding edit> are just strange not to mention his acknowledgement of a lack of understanding of how some things work: <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Evercat&diff=prev&oldid=9059797> as well as this page wasn't created right and he put his RFA in (which I have since deleted). 
oppose,Needs more experience in using Wikipedia and working with other editors. Length of time since account creation does not necessarily equate to experience. Sorry. 
oppose,dinopop please continue working hard here. your work is commendable. as of yet though i don't think you have enough experience with the community or with wikipedia. sincerely 
oppose,Get some more experience. 
oppose,Not enough experience or community involvement. 
oppose,Not enough experience on the janitorial side of things. 
oppose,This user has done some great work on the articles he created (see above). I have two reasons for opposing: 1) Low edit count. I don't expect a user to have 4000 edits before RfA but I would like to see more than his current 425. 2) Lack of experience dealing with controversial situations. I took a look at [[Talk:Olavo de Carvalho]] and wasn't very impressed with the comments in the "Author here" section. I'd prefer that WP admins didn't end comments with "Thanks morons". 
oppose,Quick check of his talk comments: Most seem to be OK but the [[Talk:Olavo de Carvalho]] mentioned by Carrp is not so hot. In any case there are not enough edits 
oppose,Great user but he hasn't made enough edits. As much as I hate edit number standards I have to oppose this user. However if you come back later with more edits I would definitely support you. 
oppose,I'm not a huge edit counter but I expect more than 425 edits from a prospective admin. I will most likely support when the user has more experience both in terms of edit number and interaction with the community. 
oppose,Not enought experience yet sorry. 
oppose,Yes I can see you've been around for a while but I don't see a consistent level of dedication to the project during that time (there are significant gaps in time between some of your contributions). I do not consider this to be . 
oppose,I don't like the "Thanks morons" comment. I may support later but definitely not this time. 
oppose,Not yet 
oppose,Agree with above. 
oppose,Never. Many of your contributions are of very doubtful usefulness (I still remember "Quarto do Chefinho" from VfD) and you fail at the task of placing a simple image on an article ([[The Underdog Project]]). Strong opposition. 
oppose,I base my decision on JuntungWu's comment about skills (below). 
support,Am I allowed to vote for myself? 
oppose,Not enough edits outside of the sandbox. In addition he has zero edits in the article namespace <http://kohl.wikimedia.org/~kate/cgibin/count_edits?user=DrZoidberg&dbname=enwiki>. 
oppose,I concur with Carbonite. I manually checked through all of his edits since he joined last november and every last one was for sandbox/history his talk page someone else's talk page or (once the sandbox/history page got moved into his userspace and VFD'd) the VFD for the sandbox/history page. 
oppose,At the risk of sounding like an evil cabalist I am tempted to just place an indefinite block on this user. He has about 1000 edits to the sandbox and not one in the article space. He has contributed nothing to Wikipedia merely wasted countless billions of valuable electrons by messing about. We shouldn't really be tolerating his presence unless he does something productive. 
oppose,I'm thinking [[WP:POINT]]. Bad faith nomination. 
oppose,Oppose and permanently block. 
oppose,I quite agree that this is a bad faith nomination but I can't understand the calls for a permanent block either. In terms of "tolerating his presence" I don't see how there's any problem doing just that: he's not polluting Wikipedia at large and though it would certainly be nice if he were to do "something productive" there are plenty of inactive users who haven't been doing anything productive either that no one would suggest we ban. By sticking to the sandbox he's not exactly participating in the spirit of the project but he's not harming it either. this nomination and for what its worth oppose the calls to block. 
oppose,Oppose. I am pleased that DrZoidberg confines his editing for the most part to the sandbox. Since there is generally no reason to move delete protect or unprotect the sandbox and since there is rarely reason to block users who vandalize the sandbox I offer the observation that adminship may not be particularly useful to DrZoidberg. Insofar as DrZoidberg is a part of Wikipedia culture at most a minor nuisance and for the most part willing to constrain his unusual pattern of editing so that it is largely within community norms I believe that calls for a ban are premature. 
oppose,Ah I know Zoidy well. In fact I've known him from his first edit. So I think it's not too presumptuous for me to say that this user is without a doubt one of the most suitable people to honor by keeping them as free spirits rather than burdening them with the terrible responsibilities adminship carries. With this in mind I'm happy to oppose this nomination. 
oppose,Well put JRM. I don't support calls for a ban from an RfA. A more revealing count of how many nonSandbox edits he made came when he moved the Sandbox to another article (DrZoidberg's Super Fun House I think it was). When that article (with its history) was deleted his edit count dropped to about 150 (he currently has a total of ~1000). Since he has made huge contributions to the Sandbox (some 850 edits) I agree that DrZoidberg should not be weighed down with a mouldy old mop and a bucket full of dirty water. 
oppose,[[Wikipedia:About|Wikipedia]] is an [[encyclopedia]]. I do not believe that this user gets that. 
oppose,Playing in the sandbox is all well and good but user has NO experience outside of sandboxrelated edits. If you wish to be an admin please do some things outside of the sandbox for a little while and I may support. 
oppose,Oppose. If I had voted just according to how long you have been present on Wikipedia I would have voted neutral. But given the nature of your contributions this is how I am voting. 
oppose,I agree with the previous votes sandbox edits are all well and good but I can't see the need for a mop and bucket in a sandbox. 
oppose,With my dying breath I curse Zoidberg! 
oppose,but gently. No edits outside the sandbox. Zoidy...do an article or two. Then we'll talk. 
oppose,Zero edits to articles? "Sandboxian"?? Maybe this nomination belongs in BJAODN! 
oppose,Ummm...no. 
oppose,I had issues with this user before mainly with edits in the Sandbox. All he does is trolls the sandbox and perhaps with a few other names/socks/whatever. I oppose. 
oppose,any user with such narrow edit scope and such childish selfnomination and behaviour in general. 
support,as nominator btw. 
support,agree with nominator (just tone down the language a bit every now and then). 
support,agree with nominator the most informed person I have ever met on the history of hurricanes. 
support,He is worthy
support,I have to agree with all of the above comments Eric has made many fine contributions to this site.[[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,He seems civil and highly knowledgable. His edit history looks pretty good plenty of edits and plenty of edit summaries. Overall good candidate.
support,I'll take a solid Wikipedian who's new to adminship over a protoadmin who's not so much about the encyclopediawriting any day. 
support,Does a lot of work on hurricanes to the detriment of say everything else but seems informed intelligent active and wellspoken and frankly that's good enough for me. 
support,I like that he has tons of "article talk" edits for me it means that he plays well with others (or maybe not but still discusses things rather than rushing into edits). 
support,I was pretty set to oppose due to low wikipedia namespace edits until I read his comment below. That swayed me I'd rather have a dedicated contributor who did a bit of admin work once in a while than one who did none at all. He deserves it. 
support,despite lack of WPspace edits because of his commitment to discretion. That's something we could use a bit more of around here.
support,per GregAsche. No doubt he will not abuse admin powers. 
support,From a look at his contributions an extremely good editor and that is good enough for me. 
support,Yes please. Lack of wikipedia namespace edits indicates a healthy reluctance to be dragged into interminable pointless disputes. 
support,(see below. And good point Lupin!) 
support,Have had a good deal of interaction with him on the hurricane pages and he has always been helpful informative and polite. 
support,His extensive involvement in the project settles it for me. As for the alleged flaw in lack of edis to Wikipedia I like Lupin's way to explain it a lot. 
support,Although I live in Florida and HATE hurricanes (especially the ones from Miami with a red hot passion I support this candidate.
support,Seems levelheaded and there is no harm in having a few admins who spend most of their time editing hurricane pages; procedual issues requiring an admin like movesoverredirects arise everwhere and frequently require more knowledge of things like "local" consensus on the affected pages than they do general policy knowledge. 
oppose,no edits to wikipedia most edits to the same pages not a lot of variety. If this person's just working on hurricane and storm articles do they really need admin powers? 
oppose,Very Very few Wikipedia edits if any 
oppose,Sorry but oppose per lack of experience in Wikispace (<50 edits in WP zero in WP talk). Please join some discussions at FAC RFC ANI or (shudder) AFD and see what it's like. 
oppose,per above. Simply not enough Wiki edits. 
oppose,Uhhpose Needs more edits to wikipedia. It shows that the user is active in the community and otherwise it can;t be seen as easily. 
oppose,due to lack of experience. 
oppose,Not saying you're not a good editor you have done a lot of hard work on the Hurricane articles and such. However you need to round out your WP experience and spend some time on discussions outside the realm of the articles you work on. Keep up the good editing. [[Special:Contributions/Who|&laquo;&raquo;]]
oppose,Weak Oppose Apologies but I've come down with a severe case of editcountitis due to some other RFAs and I don't think I can vote for any other way for anyone under 2000 edits until I get to the WikiPharmacy for my illness or the climate around here changes. Low Edit Summaries and a lack of experience in [[m:Metapedianism|Metapedianism]] clinch it(Question #3 seemed too vague) although I do think he'd be more than ready in a few months 
oppose,Oppose. Variety is the spice of life and Wikipedia space edits are a must. 
oppose,Wikipedia edits a must to show understanding of how WP works. 
oppose,It really is necessary to have a good grip on how the various processes and things work and how the community behaves behind the scenes (and how admins behave...). Experiment a little between now and your next RfA and you will learn a lot. 
oppose,as you have only been here for three days. You need some more time. 
oppose,I rarely oppose but you need more time to learn.
oppose,Hi. I'm going to have to oppose for now for three reasons: 1) there is no way to confirm your experience based on the edit history of your account; 2) you have made a few errors in this RfA that lead me to question your knowledge of Wikipedia editing in particular you have typed your responses to the above two "oppose" comments with flush lines instead of indenting them which breaks the numbering of the list (I have fixed this) and you placed your nomination in the middle of the RfA page instead of at the top where new nominations are directed to go (I have fixed this also); 3) per your answers to the questions below you state that you intend to help out by "Correcting mistakes adding new facts as they become available" but this requires no admin powers (there are plenty of users who have racked up thousands of edits worth of quality contributions of that nature without having any interest in becoming admins). Also I'd like you to clarify your answer to question 3 below for reasons I will explain there. 
oppose,Very strongly oppose. This editor created I presumed accidentally [[Eddie Segoura]]. I speedy userfied it per CSD A7 (I could have just gotten rid of it). He left me an <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASplash&diff=29005433&oldid=28962937 extremely patronising> {test1} telling me I was "experimenting with the delete function". He then recreated the article after removing it from his user page. Needless to say I deleted it again (only once: the deletion log is the victim of my impatience with the deadness of Wiki). He is unfamiliar with the standards of the encyclopedia patronising recreates speedy material Q1 says he doesn't understand what adminship is about and Q3 openly admits to intent to take actions tantamount to vandalism and which would certainly earn him a block if repetitiously carried out. He didn't answer the questions in the first draft of this RfA didn't add it to the page until prompted and then added it to the wrong part of the page. I would normally suggest that a new user try again in a few months but I wouldn't wish to mislead so I won't. (Oh and he appears not to know how to use the indentation features properly somebody has had to fix it for him. And don't lecture me on biting since I'm not and he says he's far from new.) 
oppose,for all the reasons stated by others and the answers to your questions below.
oppose,too inexperienced. 
oppose,you may be willing to accept the job but we aren't willing to accept you. Too inexperienced. Nothing more to say. 
oppose,more proof of inexperience is he fact that an RfA lasts SEVEN not TEN days. And deleting these votes is [[Wikipedia:vandalism|vandalism]]. 
oppose,as above. 
oppose,Admins should have some basic knowledge of Wikipedia editing including the fact that we don't use <a href> or <img> tags. 
oppose,Sorry. This candidate has not provided sufficient reason that we should support him. 
oppose,let's see. First we have a case of insufficient time. He's been here less than a week; certainly not long enough to learn any policies and from what I gather he's made no attempt to. Second casually mentioning fiddling his Oppose votes. That's just not helping whatsoever; and demonstrates as I noted in point one a lack of understanding of how things work here. Third his answer to question one makes me believe he doesn't realise that he doesn't need adminship. Fourth his answer to question three which I read as "I've ordered people to vandalise Wikipedia in the past for my own entertainment" that doesn't strike me as responsible nor helpful. All in all a clearcut oppose vote this is not someone I would trust with adminship. 
support,As nominator of course I support 
support,To Edwin's detractors: Edit counting is silly because it completely ignores the quality of the edits. Can anyone just take the [[diarrhea]] approach to Wikipedia and spray around thousands of edits and be considered a guru for it? Saying you can't consider Edwin because he hasn't been on long enough is silly you can see for yourself the quality of his work and dedication as proof that he is committed to Wikipedia. Maybe I don't get the goodold boys' club that makes up the Wikipedia elite. I nominated Edwin previously when we were both kinda new I admit that I jumped the gun a bit. However I think he has proven himself and has inspired me to keep at it as well. 
support,Time on Wikipedia results in experience and experience is what an admin needs. Making zillions of tiny edits of fanatical recent changes patrolling does not imbue experience. 
oppose,718 edits (of which ~300 are minor) the vast majority of which are since December 6 2004. Only 6 reverts. I'd support if he keeps up the active editing like he has been doing over the past few months and reaches 1300 edits or so. 
oppose,Good user but he hasn't the neccesary experience or commitment to janitoring for me to support. 
oppose,Needs more experience. 
oppose,A wikipedian needs to spend time here to become an administrator not the other way round. Admittedly adding religious comment without stirring up controversy is good perhaps at a later date. 
oppose,Too new. 
oppose,Needs more experience; will support at 1200 edits. 
oppose,Too few edits. 
oppose,Please get 1200 edits before requesting adminship. 
support,All my support. 
support,From what I've seen she has made quite a contribution to WP. She also has uncommon views and a strong personality. All the more reason to support her. 
support,A very nice person. 
support,Sure. 
support,Eequor's insights and comments might be a bit leftfield from time to time (downright strange at times in fact) but her work seems exemplary. we need a few admins who think not just outside the square but as if the square didn't exist and I think Eequor fits that bill. Also I daren't object to anyone whose user profile sounds scarily like my SO Alice... 
support,7 months is a lot of time. 
support,"" 
support,Sampling of edits shows attention to detail and a penchant for cleaning things up. Talk interactions look friendly sometimes sharp but not snide or derisive. I find the edit summaries amusing it's not like she's adding made up words to article space. I see no rule that says admins must be 100% serious all the time no fun allowed what a dreary place that would be. 
support,What mobilized me was that I can't believe that anyone would oppose her on the grounds of inventing words like "bulletize". She doesn't quite fit my criterion of good conflict handling. ("I really don't like conflict" doesn’t sound like that’s her strong point and I didn’t find any good evidence.) However I like her reply to RickK’s "cabal" question. If Grutness the <nowiki>{{curly}}</nowiki> boxing champ endorses her thinking outside of the box she must be good. 
support,support. This is not a [[Wikipedia:Sheep vote|sheep vote]] but a calculated investment of trust (see comments below I may still change back if really condemning diffs are shown). 
support,*This* ladies and gentlemen is prime wikipedia admin material. Humorful resiliant hard worker playful creative intelligent. I think a number of people should review what wikipedia stands for then come back and think about their vote again. This is the kind of person we need as an admin. So adminize already! 
support,She demonstrates the rare capacities of both tact and humour simultaneously and would thus would be an asset to the community even ignoring the excellent work she does on actual articles. If she believes even half of what she states <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Eequor#Wikipedia_philosophy here> she'll be a better admin than most of the those we presently have. The fact that she's stuck around and been as active as she has even after suffering all the ad hominem attacks by prominent wikipedians in her last RfA speaks volumes to her true maturity. 
support,I believe she would become a great administrator. 
support,Not suited to adminship. Which is why we need her so much. 
support,(and others) have convinced me. . May the gods have mercy on our souls. 
support,I find her different ideas refreshing. I worry about Wikipedia going stale only promoting those to adminship who are the sort who don't bother anyone. I'd like to see more people who have different views of how this project could be improved to be promoted to administrator. In Eequor's case I'm hoping it will give her a bit more legitimacy rather than the attitude I see here of dismissing her in thinly veiled ad hominem arguments. I've seen some very disappointing things in this RFA from people for whom I have a lot of respect and have seen few things about Eequor which worry me. 
support,She is capable and not a destructive force on Wikipedia. 
support,If she had switched to a new account half a year ago I don't think there would be any objections to her adminship and people would be commending her hard work. Bygones. 
support,since she has shown the ability to acknowledge past mistakes.
support,7 months of quality editing seems enough. Nothing wrong with being different! | [[User talk:Flcelloguy|Give me a note! ]]</font color>| 
support,I will come out of hiding to support this one. Knowledgeable hardworking goodnatured much more so than many current admins. 
support,Eequor is contrary and often holds a minority opinion. Which I consider a good thing! The only problem with it is that she often rubs people the wrong way but it appears she's making an effort to acknowledge and handle that lately rather than inflame it. Nothing at all objectionablefar from itabout her article editing and as per Seth that she's stayed around and continued to edit just as much as before after her previous failed RfA speaks well of her. (Minor detail: I find the neologisms perfectly understandable.) 
support,For all the normal reasons plus her edit summaries are appropriate understandable and more detailed the comments left by some admins on the side of oppose <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&target=Raul654> <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&target=Ambi> 
support,A great contributor who is obviously very committed to Wikipedia. As said there's nothing wrong with being different. I rather like the edit summaries. 
support,Happy with the response given by the questions I previously had. Therefore I can support. 
support,Radiant's reasoning is quite convincing. Seven months is a long time and I believe that Eequor has matured into a user who will make a fine admin. 
support,I hereby and with a most happy of hearts supporterize the administratitude of this fine lady person. 
support,Firstlyizedly I would like to on my knees beg Eequor to not stop editing wikipedia no matter which way the adminship vote goes. This place should never become a uniformitydriven community. Secondously I would ask of her that if she does get the adminship (a thing devoutly to be wished for); she will prove all those who supported her adminship correct. I will not comment on the oppose votes as I do not wish to embarrass people I respect nor dignify those who I do not. 
support,Excellent editor. 
support,ize. Good idea about the edit summaries I think I'll start using them tooI can't figure what the problem is there. But mainly I checked out recent edits and that's a good editor. And vote 34 on a pogostick is enough to melt any remaining ice in my heart. 
support,I think Eequor is a borderline case but one look at the opposition some of whom make a lot worse admins than Eequor ever will inclines me to strongly support her. Her edit summaries are about the best thing about her: harmless fun. 
support,I completely disagree with her opinions but I don't think those would make her a bad admin. There are some examples of bad decisions in her edit history but I can't find anything recent so I'll [[WP:FAITH|assume good faith]] and support. 
support,Tentatively support. Kim Bruning vouches for her and I trust his judgement. 
support,I'd only oppose if I found any evidence that she would be likely to abuse her admin abilities. Well yeah she did make a silly edit to [[Astrochicken]] back in January but that's over and done with. Most of the objections to her adminship seem to be variations on "I don't agree with her". I [[There is no cabal|don't always agree with her views]] either but I don't vote for RfA candidates based on whether I agree with them. Eequor is an excellent editor and a dedicated janitor and her adminship would do no harm and a lot of good. 
support,I've reviewed the complaints of those who oppose and her recent contribution history. I don't see anything since the last RFA worth denying adminship over. Also contrition demonstrated and suffering loads of criticism while remaining active here are good signs. Further although I'd never support the use of them in the articles themselves I found the neologies in the edit summaries as helpful as my own overly wordy edit summaries most of the time. They could be improved but at least she's using them. 
support,Agree with Grace Note. 
oppose,Disapprovize. The neologisms are still there and still as unhelpful as ever. 
oppose,No way. 
oppose,Yep. Continues to leave useless madeupword edit summaries. That alone shows a profound disrespect of other contributors. 
oppose,Decided to oppose after reading through previous RfA and doing some research. I suspect that (if I don't mention it) someone will point out that "7 months is a long time" or something similar. In my opinion though 7 months really isn't a long time and I'm not prepared to believe that this user has completely turned themselves around during that very short time especially considering the observations of Mrfixter and Netoholic above. 
oppose,Still don't trust Eequor. 
oppose,Eequor is a good contributor but in the past she has shown some seriously bad judgement (a look at the old RFA nom is telling...) which makes me very very concerned about the prospect of her being an admin. Func claims that she's improved since then I'd like to see some concrete examples of good judgement calls she has made since then. 01:48 Jun 17 2005 (UTC) Since no one has made any effort to respond to my comment I'm switching to oppose. 
oppose,After some consideration oppose she's a fine editor most of the time but I don't want to see her as an admin. Too unreasonable at times. 
oppose,English Wikipedia needs admins but reliable and psychically stable ones. Sorry I oppose. 
oppose,I'm not very convinced of the suitability of this editor by the list of his supporters. 
oppose,History does not inspire confidence that Wikipedia policy is well understood. 
oppose,It's regrettable this discussion has gotten so polar. But that's part of what bothers me. Few other good editors would arouse such vehement dislike from so many otherwise reasonable people. Responses here seem more like trying to whitewash past issues than admitting mistakes. Recent editing is said to be much better so great keep that up. But such erratic past behavior leads me to believe more is to come. People change but not often quickly and usually only for very strong reasons. If there were a simple process for deadminning I'd be fine with giving her a shot but as it is the risk isn't worth it especially when considering she doesn't need admin powers to do most editing. 
oppose,Weak oppose I see good and bad in this contributor. Unfortunately she attracts far too much controversy for Adminship; her actions whether right or wrong would cause polarisation.[[Image:Flag_of_Australia.svg|15px]] 
oppose,sorry. Just seems to have some odd ideas. 
oppose,There is an idea brewing among supporters that she has mended her ways since her (failed) nomination seven months ago. I do not agree. Looking back to six months ago we can see one of Eequor's typical inflammatory edits<http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2004/Candidate_statements/Endorsements/Sam_Spade&diff=8009399&oldid=8009258> where she removed all comments in opposition to Sam Spade's ArbCom nomination. To be fair I have to say she removed Sam Spade's one supporter along with fifteen of his detractors. I do agree with the supporters who say [[reeducation]] is possible and a bad editor can become a good editor perhaps even one who can one day be an admin. But I do not think a few weeks is good enough. For me to support Eequor's nomination I think more time has to pass I think she needs to show she is making a contribution to Wikipedia and not stirring up a hornet's nest (as she has done in the past many times) and I think she needs to convince people she has turned over a new leaf. Not enough time nor effort has passed for her to be considered admin material. Just six months ago she was mass deleting the comments on fifteen users for a matter I was concerned with Sam Spade's ArbCom nomination and she was wrecking havoc in other areas more recent than that five months ago vandalizing Astrochicken<http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Astrochicken&diff=9033071&oldid=9032779> and so forth. A few weeks of calming down is not good enough more time and more effort are needed. I personally think we've made a mistake in electing a few of the existing admins and this is not a mistake that should be repeated. 
oppose,I'm all for neologisms in edit summaries but some of the edits linked above worry me. 
support,I strongly support him because I don't think it matters how many edits one may have but their devotion to Wikipedia is what matters. I know that EinsteinMC2 has graciously helped me and I to him he deserves this. CalculusStudent23 user's first edit. Vote should not be counted 
oppose,Needs way more experience. 223 total edits with only 23 being made to article namespace <http://kohl.wikimedia.org/~kate/cgibin/count_edits?hash=c614cb98f6838b051bf3491a45c05c7ef5869a60&user=EinsteinMC2&dbname=enwiki>. Half of his edits have been to his own userspace. Also he didn't really become active until about a week ago. 
oppose,Strong a lot more experience needed 
oppose,Welcoming sockpuppet vandals isn't a terribly good idea: <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:RhiannonH&curid=2978623&diff=26297178&oldid=26271671> <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3A172_sysop_status&diff=26297842&oldid=26247731> 
oppose,Three months? No way. [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
oppose,Just not enough experience.
oppose,Oppose. Normally I wouldn't pile it on but I just think you need some advice: 1) Creating other accounts (CalculusStudent23) to vote for you is strongly disapproved of. 2) Using formal selfpromoting collegeessaytype language while it may come naturally to you is unusual on Wikipedia; the atmosphere here is relatively informal and people will look at you strangely for using the kind of phrasing you do. But you're perfectly welcome to make good contributions and accrue some more experience that will let you become an admin.~ 
oppose,per Nickpar Just not enough experience 223 Edits WAY to few and that sockpuppet kills it 
oppose,Did not follow instructions in creating RfA (I corrected it). Engaged in vandalism (<http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Extraordinary_Machine&diff=prev&oldid=20837739>). Last edit before submitting his own RfA was an AfD (<http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Andrew_Goetz&diff=prev&oldid=24229840>) for an article that should be tagged for speedy deletion. Nominee did not follow instructions on this edit either as he did not create the AfD page just added the AfD tag to the article. Uses edit summaries just 22% of the time. I won't be doing a chart for this one. 
oppose,I agree with the points brought up by Durin. Good editor but needs more experience. 
oppose,Fewer than 1000 edits many of which are minor in nature. A shade more than two months experience. Still no user page which will annoy some people. Might support in future with further seasoning. 
oppose,per Kate's tool (which is working for me right now see <http://kohl.wikimedia.org/~kate/cgibin/count_edits?user=Empty2005&dbname=enwiki here> and above comments. I don't think edit counts are that big a deal but the lack of experience is obvious from it. No article talk edits 6 Wikipedia edits. 
oppose,per Durin. I believe you are a very good editor who does hard work but please just get a few more edits in there. Here are a few links: [[Newpages]] [[Recent Changes]] [[Wikipedia:Untagged images]] etc. Also try to get involved in the community. You could join [[Wikipedia:Esperanza]] [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Kindness Campaign]] and you could vote here and participate on the talk page. All the best and Good luck!
oppose,way too few Talk namespace edits and engaging in blatant vandalism only a month before requesting adminship doesn't look good at all. 
oppose,Not even remotely within a cannon shot of the standards and the very selfnom here is nearly a sign of contempt for our processes. 
oppose,not enough edits hasn't been here for long enough engaged in vandalism needs to use edit summaries more needs a bit more than 7 wikipedia namespace edits. You are a good editor but correct what I just listed and reapply in a couple months and I'll gladly support. 
oppose,because of all the reasons already mentioned. 
oppose,Sorry. I'm not normally into editcountitis but for folks who want admin powers to close AfD's I expect over 1000 edits because they should know AfD very well. "Bettersafethansorry" vote here and I'll be happy to support with a little more experience. 
oppose,until the editor has more experience. <1000 edits is too few.
oppose,too few edits. 
oppose,per above 
oppose,The edit count is low but he does mention that this wasn't his first account. My main reasons for opposing are several statements on his user page that implies he's seeking a forum to voice his strong opinions and also the lack of participation in VfD and RC patrol. 
oppose,More solid experience needed. 
oppose,I'm with Taxman. 
oppose,For now. 
oppose,Needs more time and work maybe in the future. 
support,You could probably do with more interaction but I don't see why you shouldn't be an admin. 
support,I voted back in July; I'm glad I stopped by here so I can vote again. Falcon is a great user and his work on the Dewey Decimal System is profoundly appreciated. Generally I don't support people with less than 1200 edits; however I believe Falcon is good enough to be an administrator. 
oppose,Not enough experience. Been around a long time but a sampling of edits shows nearly all to be minor. Userpage shows a general lack of maturity (having nothing to do with age) as does editing pattern on [[Vampire lifestyle]]. Of course keep up the good you do but I'm not sure you need admin rights to do any of it. 
oppose,Needs some more seasoning and a sustained effort. Editing has been very sparse since the last adminship selfnom a year ago: very quiet then nearly four hundred edits in the last week. (With respect to those it would be helpful if Falcon made more use of the minor edit flag.) More examples of interaction with editors would also help. I quite like the work on [[Wikipedia:Dewey Decimal System]]. 
oppose,I'm afraid I'm going to have to vote oppose. Besides not having much user interaction (a must for an admin) I feel like the way he discussed the [[Vampire lifestyle]] with another [[Wikipedia:Wikipedians|Wikipedian]] was somewhat inappropriate. Though I'm not saying which side was right the inability to come to a civil compromise worries me. However I do' believe that you (Falcon) are (is) a dedicated [[Wikipedia:Wikipedians|Wikipedian]] keep up your good work especially in the [[Wikipedia:Dewey Decimal System]]! Given a few months and more interaction with the community I'd be happy to support your adminship. Thanks! 
oppose,Voting oppose for now; I think you can become a great user but you're not to the point yet where admin privileges are necessary. 
oppose,Lacks the edits to be administrator and in my opinion an admin should have more than 1100 edits in a year. Could be a good user but needs to interact more I think. 
support,I note about 1295 edits fairly well distributed (nice work on templates and in AfD). Yep this'un is ready. 
support,I agree. . [[Image:Flag_of_Europe_and_Austria.svg|20px]] 
support,Need more admins. 
support,Excellent job on spotting and reporting rv's and POV's. 
support,I like his edits.
support,Yes. 
support,The more vandalfighters and banners the merrier. 
support,We need more vandal fighters not everyone needs to focus primarily on writing articles. 
support,Excellent mix of Wikipedianamespace and articlenamespace contributions. Great mission statement. 
support,Long time no see! Good luck Firebug. 
support,Being an expert on fair use is not a requirement for adminship being prepared to discuss with others is a requirement and Firebug has indicated he is willing to do this. I see no reason to oppose based on this and I've not had any problems in my interactions with him meanign that I am happy to support. 
support,[[Wikipedia:Esperanza|ε]]
support,good vandal fighter. 
oppose,with regret. While seems to be an excellent vandalfighter I am concerned about this editor's stance on [[:Image:Janet Jackson Nude Sunbathing.jpg]]. after tagged the image as lacking proper copyright information made <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AExtraordinary_Machine&diff=29746377&oldid=29745945 this edit> which pasted a number of images to [[User talk:Extraordinary Machine]] (accidentally fixed it quickly) with an argument that seemed to be "Other people have failed to follow [[Wikipedia:Fair use]] so there is consensus to not do so". The lack of familiarity with wikimarkup and lack of familiarity with [[Wikipedia:Fair use]] are of less concern to me than the fact that the user's response was to attempt to argue that other problematic cases meant that [[:Image:Janet Jackson Nude Sunbathing.jpg]] must also be okay rather than immediately researching the issue and attempting to minimize any risk of copyright infringement. That attitude concerns me. 
oppose,per JKelly. In the final analysis I actually think Firebug was probably right about the fair use claim (which stems from the content's fame as widelydiscussed news item and doesn't require attribution to the holder if attribution to the disseminating news service is given. However I think Firebug's argument was less than thoughtful; that in combination with the low edit count tips the balance to a "bettersafethansorry" vote. I will happily support in a few months and I'm sure Firebug will be much more deliberate with copyrights after this issue. 
oppose,Way too low an edit count 1) for us to make an accurate judgement on their suitability for adminship and 2) for Firebug to have the knowledge of the ins and outs of the Wikipedia that an admin needs. 
oppose,worried about depth of knowledge. Fair use is fairly obscure in terms of what I'd like an admin to know but I'd want them not to make statements that are incorrect (such as rationales not being Wiki practises) because it belies not having read up properly before pronouncing. 
oppose,for now. Too few edits.
oppose,I can't support someone who a deletes a benign and selfevidently true statement like this by calling it "original research": <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=United_States_Postal_Service&diff=30414723&oldid=30273793> An adminstrator should know better. 
oppose,Oppose. Sorry. JKelly and others raise some good points. Just try to keep up editing and make sure you always use edit summaries and I will support you in the future. 
oppose,He chose to <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&target=Firebug&offset=0&limit=500&namespace=10 edit war> on the wrong side of the metatemplate problem and was extremely rude to me in the process. I have no doubt that he wants adminship just so he can wield a bigger stick. Also he called <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Xiong&diff=prev&oldid=13364212 this> vandalism... 
oppose,No evidence to show that he has reformed from his earlier rubyouthewrongway ways. 
oppose,seems to be too POV. 
oppose,A number of encounters with this user have made me uneasy. Also his very first edit <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=AY38910&diff=prev&oldid=13792976> shows prior knowledge of Wikipedia and I'm concerned about the severalmonthslong gap until November 23 but then asking for adminship within nine days of returning. 
oppose,as per SlimVirgin and all of the fair use talk. 
oppose,Only 65 edits 
oppose,Per Aranda. Get a few hundred or few thousand edits under your belt. I'd also like to strongly encourage you to remove your application just so you don't get barraged with oppose votes... 
oppose,Sorry no. [[Image:Flag_of_Europe_and_Austria.svg|20px]] 
oppose,Only ~450 edits. Good breadth of contributions so far. Don't see much evidence of vandalism fighting though it could be that I can't tell from the very few edit summaries. I like what I see but it's just not enough. (BTW: frappes are yummy). 
oppose,Too often does not put edit summaries. 
oppose,Good so far. But I'd like to see a lot more work done by Freestylefrappe. 
oppose,Too few edits and too many of those have no edit summary. Also there isn't much to see on user or talk pages. I may well support a future nomination if there has been progress in those areas. 
oppose,Edits not really high enough and doesn't even bother to answer questions below. 
oppose,Not enough demonstrated experience (less than half of my own and I don't think I'm experienced enough to be an administrator either). Not answering the standard questions is also worrisome. Apply again in a few more months. 
support,Good longtime user with many good contributions to wikipedia. 
support,[[That's hot]]. 
support,fine user with good reasons for wanting adminship. As for the fury I haven't noticed any. 
oppose,Looking through contribs obviously good user but does not appear would benefit from admin powers at all plus doesn't leave edit summaries frequently. 
oppose,STRONG OPPOSE failed to do RfA self nom properly which I had to fix (and got caught in an edit conflict with Deathphoenix trying to fix). Failed to list ending time. Failed to answer questions. Too little time on pedia. Too little edits. I sense a pileon. 
oppose,(triple edit conflict) Sorry at 271 <http://tools.wikimedia.de/~kate/cgibin/count_edits?user=Garykirk&dbname=enwiki edits> at less than two months of activity you need some more time (and much more edits) to learn the ins and outs of Wikipedia. With time you'd be a good user. Even with this RFA there were a few problems: <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship&diff=29207963&oldid=29201374 Inserting> a space before a line of text results in that text being displayed as a fixed width font not as the Wikiformatting. You should "subst" the RfA template otherwise when other people try to edit your RFA page they get to the template page instead. Finally selfnominators should already answer the candidate questions before putting themselves up for nomination. Come back when you have more experience (I might as well register my vote before perusing the nowanswered questions before I enter into yet another edit conflict). [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
oppose,He needs to do more editing before requesting for adminship. 271 edits is not enough. 
oppose,Do a lot more here over the next few months and try again. (Can someone end this?) 
oppose,per reasons already given too soon more edits etc. 
support,without reservation and as nominator
support,without a reservation because I don't need a reservation my table is waiting. 
support,My only reservation was this <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/WhatWouldEmperorNortonDo&diff=30371290&oldid=30360049> puzzling "easy support" vote in an RfA for a user with less than 70 edits. No reason to oppose Gator1 though and I think he'll make a good admin. 
support,A regular at [[WP:AIV]] which is where I think I first encountered Gator1. He was light on the edit summaries when he was new but use since perhaps early November has been great. 
support,unlikely to abuse administrator tools. 
support,with two cats on his user page he must be a worthy admin. 
support,Good vandal fighter I think he'd be a valuable addition to the sysop ranks. 
support,Normally I would wait until 5 months of experience but I think that this user could do good as an admin. 
support,I remember Gator1 from when he first came here then sometimes a bit too eager to kill off newbies or vandals (it's often a fine line). But in my opinion he's grown to a good and very dedicated wikipedian who has learned his ways around here and now would be a fine admin. And I belive wikipedia would be a better place if he becomes one. 
support,Gator is a regular at [[WP:AIV]] and is a dedicated vandal fighter. He is helpful to newbies and courteous all around. He has brought a number of issues to my attention that required admin intervention; his handling of those events leads me to believe he can be trusted to handle problematic situations with his own administrative tools. 
support,this is a good well intentioned user and also I trust BD2412's judgement.
support,Gator is thoughtful earnest and a truly decent Wikipedian. He's got a solid head on his shoulders to boot. Certainly not perfect but I've never met a WP who is. We should be so lucky as to have him as an admin.(I do recall that he like I was "announced" by BD777 to have permission to "police" his page but I don't recall that he ever gave BD an advance okay for that (I myself didn't) nor that he did much if any actual policing. If he did ever delete vandalism attacks or snide remarks from BD's page he was not only entitled but obliged to do that. So I'm not sure how or why that should be held against him. In l'affaire BD I also recall that Gator thought for himself did what he thought was right and maintained behavior far surpassing some of BD's loudest and most obnoxious accusers.) Gator is qualified to learn the ropes of the admin's duties and to carry out those duties. I predict he will be better than average at the job that he will learn from others with humility and that he will continue to think for himself and not be driven to conform. 
support,Good contributor. I have looked at the concerns regarding his defense of BigDaddy but it is perhaps more a sign that he assumes good faith further than others. 
support,I have had only positive interactions with Gator. A great addition. [[User Talk:Texture|&#964;]]
support,Forgive and forget. Does good work. 
support,I see no reason not to support at this time. Good editor. 
support,per [[Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/BigDaddy777#Outside_View_of_Gator1]]. I think that it is wonderful that he is able to see the good in everyone and we could use more people like this. Not at all trigger happy and seems to be a genuine contributor who will help others. 
support,I'm going to be bold and support. A little conflict is healthy and Gator1 seems to be a decent fellow. 
support,per and . I just had an interesting and I came away from it impressed with Gator's gutsy opposition to what he saw as a witchhunt in progress. There are some really ugly dynamics that develop way too easily at web communities like this (I remember some nasty incidents at h2g2 back when I lived there...) and I like having admins around with a sensitivity to that. The impulses that he was acting on there tempered by the time since that he's spent learning more about Wikipedia and being a good vandal fighter convince me that he'll make a fine administrator. 
support,Orange and Blue for a fellow [[University of Florida|UF]] alum...GO GATOR(s)!
support,Dealt with an anxious contributor nicely and I admire his willingness to defend someone against what he saw as an unfair situation. 
support,Responsible already does a lot to improve Wikipedia would do far more as an admin. 
support,per nomination. 
support,I've read all the oppose votes and most of the materials that they linked to Although it is obvious that Gator1 stepped into something he clearly regrets I do not see it as an indication that he will misuse the tools. Hand him the toolkit and wish him good luck. 
support,per nomination. 
support,I trust both the candidate and nominator. 
oppose,Reluctant Oppose per the concerns of Katefan below. I too got a bad vibe from Gator when he was a new user. I understand that he's probably reformed but my "bettersafethansorry" instinct prevents me from supporting now. Happy to support in two months even as long as record stays fair. 
oppose,I looked through this user's VfD/AfD comments and they all seem to be "Delete per nom". A little more variety would be helpful... 
oppose,Weak oppose I seem to remember him being too involved in the BigDaddy777 controversy. 
oppose,Gator1 fits the time cap of 3mos however I would like to see more edits say 3000 before I would consider promoting to a full janitor post.Jay (
oppose,Too confrontational 12 months back will support in 34 months time.
oppose,Needs to have a few more months yet. Right now memories of his efforts to support BD777 are with me. Give it a few more months. 
oppose,Sorry nothing against you personally; I believe you that you got caught up in the BD777 affair and that you had no ill intentions but I'd advise you to wait a few months before applying again in case this fails. I'll gladly support thenyour edits are good and your record is only marred by this one single issue in my opinionbut it's too soon now sorry. [[Image:Flag_of_Europe_and_Austria.svg|20px]] 
oppose,as per above and below. Come back in 3 months. 
oppose,due to the BD777 issue. As I recall he became a little too combative in that disputeI think that he is a little too excitable. I would be very apprehensive about his becoming an admin. 
oppose,per Katefan and users subsequent behavior at the censorship project. 
oppose,as per Katefan and my personal experience with this user who defended BigDaddy777 in very unproductive ways even while the user was blatantly violating policy and creating bad will. Gator1's welcome to continue to edit but I have major concerns about him becoming an admin based on what I've seen of his impartiality and approach to conflict resolution. 
oppose,(strongly) come back in 6 months with an examplary record and i'll say yes. here's a few examples off his talk of why i think it's too soon.<http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Gator1&diff=25440531&oldid=25440407><http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Gator1&diff=25439932&oldid=25439764><http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Gator1&diff=25442852&oldid=25442791><http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Gator1&diff=25437604&oldid=25369536><http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Gator1&diff=23101707&oldid=23101464> [[User talk:Gator1#My opposition|lengthier explanation]] of present opposition given on Gator's talk page. 
oppose,Strong Oppose During the BigDaddy777 debacle Gator1 made numerous personal attacks. and supported BigDaddy's personal attacks on others. <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Gator1/Archive/#This_is_TOO_Rich>. In fact during the BigDaddy777 incident Gator1 specifically instructed BigDaddy to ignore the RFC about him and repeatedly stated that there was nothing wrong with BigDaddy's behavior. <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_comment/BigDaddy777>. BigDaddy777 has since been not only permanently banned but has multiple restrictions on top of that. <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/BigDaddy777> 
oppose,with a strong inclination to vote next time around. 
oppose,Shows an appropriate attitude in responses to the questions below but since Gator1 has only been around for a relatively short time past problems are not sufficiently distant. 
oppose,but am optimistic about supporting Gator1 next time around. Given his recent good contributions I didn't want to vote oppose until I'd had a chance to look through the [[Laura Schlessinger]] page he referenced. There are a few comments there but nothing that would rise to the level of the significant conflict resolution I was hoping to see. Because I have yet to see how Gator1 would handle himself in another partisan conflict I must officially vote oppose. I was reluctant to bring up specific diffs from the past because he seems to be doing a fine job these days but I fear that others voting yes have not adequately assessed the past situation. Gator1 may have been defending someone as a kneejerk reaction to feeling he was "ganged up on" but the manner in which he did it was not all right for any editor much less an administrator. I would be reluctant to support someone for admin with this short amount of time on Wikipedia regardless of who they were; combined with this past incident it makes it impossible for me to support. I look forward to Gator1's next nomination before which time I hope to see him in action in another dispute and moreover I hope there are no hard feelings here. (Addendum to my comments at "Neutral" below) · [[User talk:Katefan0|(scribble)]]/
oppose,Needs more experience.

support,I came across this vote not via RFA but by checking out this user who has put some work into making VFD work well (in the particular case I was checking out [[Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Fjact]]). User has 1706 edits spread over different categories and has been around since June 2004 (becoming regularly active in November 2004). Most of the opposition to the RFA acknowledges Gkhan has been around since 2004 has 1300+ edits in nonarticle space and has made a positive contribution to Wikipedia. The main reason for opposition seems to be due to his focus on namespaces other than articles. We have a division of labor in real life and if someone is not the world's best article writer but does a great job on lots of thankless tasks around Wikipedia and everything about them is adminworthy except for what some might perceive as a lack of article namespace contributions as far as myself I consider them adminworthy anyhow. What I've seen of Gkhan has been positive and if the only objection is lack of article namespace contributions it's not enough of one to send me to neutral or oppose. My main concern is preventing "rogue admins" who will push POV block people and protect pages willynilly causing many people to complain about them and the high bar set to deadmin someone. I don't have this sort of fear with regards to Gkhan. And that Gkhan's main contributions are outside of the article namespace is not enough of an objection to remove my support. 
support,I've reviewed some of Gkhan's recent edits and it looks to me like he/she has made a positive contribution across the board. Polite and focused in interactions with other editors and doing a lot of detailed work on janitorial tasks. Wikipedia is a big place and there is plenty of room for specialization. 
support,A good user who seems to be well experienced in how Wikipedia works. 
support,one doesn't need to contribute a lot to main namespace to be a good admin. 
support,Agree with Grue. 
support,Nonnamespace work gave me the impression Gkhan was already an admin. While making contributions is a great way of getting adminrelated experience (e.g. settling content disputes) there are other ways of acquiring these skills. 
support,You can be a good admin without being a good "scribe" and I think of at least a couple of existing admins who contribute very little to articles but lots to adminny things and help the 'pedia out just the same. 
support,I'm impressed with his edits to the talk spaces which is where I think the admin role really comes into play. Communication with other users: very important for an admin. 
support,You don't necessarily need lots of article edits to be an admin communication skills are much more important. Besides newpage patrol is really seriously underrated since edits on deleted pages don't show up in your editcount. 
support,Gkhan has shown himself to be both dedicated and trustworthy. Adding content to articles is important but so is welcoming newcomers and going through the new articles. If Gkhan has recognised that editing articles is not his strong point I fail to see how asking him to reach certain arbitrary edit counts helps Wikipedia when he could help by doing things which he is good at. 
support,as Splash said a large number of article contributions is not absolutely necessay. Gkhan now has almost 2000 total edits and has over 500 edits in the Wikipedia namespace. He is resonably mature and helps out around here and is suitable for admin. 
support,A great person and someone I think we would be able to trust with admin rights. More edits would make more people happy but my personal interaction with him leads me to believe that he's fit for adminship. | [[User_talk:Linuxbeak|Talk]] | 
oppose,Only 367 edits to article namespace. Ultimately this work is the whole point of the encyclopedia. 
oppose,Gkhan is clearly here in good faith but I reckon is a little inexperienced as yet.
oppose,I'd love to vote for you but I don't think now's the time. 
oppose,Borderline but you could insert cats sort stubs fix bad articles lots of things that don't involve having talent as a writer. I agree with you about Ed Poor though so your attitude is commendable. If you fail come back in three months and drop me a note. 
oppose,I have an edit standard that is nearly 3x higher than your current total. Also I get the feeling you are fishing for compliments by basically trashing your own work in your nomination. A few more edits and a little more selfconfidence is needed. 
oppose,Man you need more experience. If you don't have 2000+ edits I wouldn't bother applying here. 
oppose,Edits to article namespace are a must the heart of this encyclopedia is its articles and 367 edits don't meet my admin standards. Sorry. 
oppose,Will support at 1000 mainspace edits. 
oppose,not nearly enough edits. 
support,Did a good job chasing a vandal from my user page 
oppose,Sorry I think you need much more experience I'm sure that given time you will make a good admin though! 
oppose,<http://kohl.wikimedia.org/~kate/cgibin/count_edits?hash=871d1075f78dd88194a13375b79712a22c4cd8d5&user=Goeagles4321&dbname=enwiki Only 227 edits.> I'd recommend that you review [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Standards]] to see the kind of experience level most people want to see in potential sysops.
oppose,Sorry you need to have been around a little longer than this. 
oppose,LAST oppose. Please do not pile on any further. 
support,Welcome back! 
support,'bout time. 
support,Of course. 
support,Yep. 
support,ed then still support now. 
support,I retain my support of him. 
support,on looking back in history at how Guanaco lost his adminship I can only compare it to a [[penis panic]]. 
support,as before. 
support,Yes. 
support,yes 
support,I definately support Snowspinner's nomination. 
support,I believe he's learned from his mistake. 
support,That Guanaco was able to accept the removal of his admin status speaks well of him. 
support,Hard worker can be trusted with privileges IMO. 
support,Definitely. 
support,and furthermore support 
support,Fixed term deopping would have been fairer in my opinion. 
support,I assume good faith. 
support,This is a no brainer. 
support,Good user.
support,There are some Wikipedians who should learn to forgive... We are humans we all make mistakes. 
support,slightly tentative but in the absence of a probation option I'm prepared to give him the chance. I do trust that Guanaco will take note of the reluctance of such respected figures as RickK and Ambi to give their support and act a little more cautiously from now on. I think he can be trusted. 
support,can't see why not 
support,While I understand concerns about possible misuses of sysop status the<http://mail.wikimedia.org/pipermail/wikienl/2005March/020427.html 172/Ed Poor fiasco> has shown these as a widespread issue that can only be addressed by continued political oversight. 
support,What's the issue with Willy on Wheels? Clearly he ought to be hardbanned. Apparently he isn't. (Is this true?) Guanaco explains that he edited a page to reflect this fact. Maybe the fact ought to be changed rather than Guanaco chastised. 
support,Never should have lost it in the first place. 
support,Whatever his past transgressions I strongly consider three months enough time for him to have realised them and resolved to do better. Guanaco has impressed me in the past and I voted against his desysopping for that very reason. 
support,13:28 14 Mar 2005 (UTC) One of my last acts as an admin and a contributor on this site. Let them back. 
support,I'm a little shocked at the opposing comments particularly the ones that advocate "making an example" of Guanaco. I for one am pretty impressed that he is taking up the neccessary work to regain the trust of the community; think how much easier it would have been to create a new account from scratch with a clean slate. However he is taking the harder route to clear his name in front of the people who originally desysopped him and I find that pretty respectable. This clearly shows that he has an appreciation for the Wikipedia community and policy. I have to support that. 
support,Give him another chance. 
oppose,No.
oppose,Not only no but ... well no. 
oppose,Oppose. A loose cannon for a long stretch a few months of keeping one's nose clean isn't enough to make up for that. Still a troll protector <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&diff=10735847&oldid=10735767>; if Guanaco had the power to unblock he certainly would have done so. 
oppose,Oppose. I gave away some of my own rights to have him deadmined.
oppose,Three months is a pretty short time and the edit history of the last months would hardly have motivated a candidacy. Can Guanaco do more good than bad for Wikipedia as an admin? The answers below may seem tough or cool to some and arrogant to others. In the context of the prehistory I find the attitude far too arrogant. It worries me that a long list of the more involved Wikipedians great Guanaco back as if this attitude is what we need and wish for. 
oppose,I was going to vote "neutral" until I checked his contributions and saw his most recent edit <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:List_of_banned_users&diff=prev&oldid=11047802> which was removing all information on "Willy on Wheels" from the banned users page (it was reverted soon after <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:List_of_banned_users&diff=0&oldid=11047802>). I do not want an admin to display this erratic behavior. 
oppose,Maybe. Can "support" voters put forth a more substantial reason why you're supporting now especially if you previously voted oppose? 13:17 9 Mar 2005 (UTC) No [[Wikipedia:Bots|bots]] in user accounts. Period. 
oppose,Quite frankly I'm afraid I can't support. And I'm a little bewildered as to why so many people have changed their vote from just three months ago. Has Guanaco done something terribly worthwhile or noteworthy that I've missed? I am weary of Guanaco's behaviour and maybe it has changed maybe not. But as hard as it is to deadmin people around here I'm not keen on finding out. 
oppose,I am not very familiar with Guanaco or his history so this vote is more based on a general observation. It seems to me that if sysopping is "not a big deal" desysopping is. It hardly ever happens; so if an admin so misbehaves as to be required by the AC to go through RFA again and 22 people oppose it after having had an opportunity to observe the person in action as an administrator I am not sure that person should ever be an admin again or if so it should be after a much longer period of redemption than two or three months and a relatively small number of edits. I wouldn't assume that a person would mature very much in three months; so I would really want to have seen a lot of good edits in stressful situations to feel that trust in him as an admin was again warranted. If the slate was wiped clean after the desysop he should at least show as much good activity as a new user who joined the site that day would be required to have in order to be supported on RFA as if for example he had simply created a new account and had been working all this time to establish a new persona. That hasn't happened. 
oppose,Neutral for now but leaning towards oppose. ~500 edits most of which are minor tweaks since his desysopping is not sufficient to inspire confidence that his previous erratic behavior does not continue. Given we have enough fresh qualified candidates for adminship I'd prefer supporting them instead. Also seems to be running a bot on his main account (see my question below). 10:23 10 Mar 2005 (UTC) <Vote changed from neutral to oppose; someone who defends can be all that bad. 
oppose,Oppose at this time because it seems to me Guanaco ought to be willing to demonstrate plenty of actual good activity before expecting his admin privileges back. Mere absence of bad activity in the sense that as RickK says he's hardly done ANYTHING doesn't give much indication of how he'd use the privileges next time round. 
oppose,Strongly oppose (moved from neutral). It is now abundantly clear with his attitude towards dealing with The Recycling Troll and even Willy on Wheels that he has not changed in the least. RickK clearly has a point he needs to actually show a good deal of good behaviour before we trust him again. 
oppose,Oppose (moved from neutral). Removing Whilly on Wheels from the list of banned users <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:List_of_banned_users&diff=11047802&oldid=11046414> should have been done in combination with a discussion on the talk page. However talk page comment was added only <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:List_of_banned_users&diff=11104003&oldid=11067254> after Carrp commented on this when he changed his vote <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Guanaco2&diff=11058072&oldid=11057341>. This seems to be exactly the behavior that got him in trouble last time. (Note: The Whilly on wheels was removed by Guanaco again <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:List_of_banned_users&diff=0&oldid=11100946> this time with talk comment <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:List_of_banned_users&diff=0&oldid=11104778>). 
oppose,Oppose. What RickK said. 
oppose,Oppose. Sorry but there are still too many question marks around his previous and recent behaviour for me to support his reinstatement. 
oppose,Oppose. Sorry Guanaco there are some good reasons to have you back but comments on [[Wikipedia talk:List of banned users]] make it clear to me that you are still seriously out of step with the community on what does and doesn't constitute blockable behavior. It might be a good risk to have Guanaco an admin but the fact that it is a risk coupled with the fact that we have dozens of excellent admins (and no apparent shortage of good candidates) who are far less risky make opposition my choice after careful thought. 
oppose,Questionable judgment reckless unilateralism and refusal to admit mistakes are bad enough in an editor. Guanaco's behavior before his desysopping demonstrated why noone with these traits ought to be trusted with adminship and I have no confidence (yet) that he won't immediately resume his old behavior. (And the way he tagged this vote for speedy deletion <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Guanaco2&diff=11152084&oldid=11152064> after it turned unfavorable just clinches my doubts.) —
oppose,Three months of very little activity doesn't give a lot to base an opinion on. Recent activity however reminds me of the comments from three months ago. Also as a candidate for adminship he marked his RfA for speedy deletion instead of withdrawing in the normal fashion. As a former admin and a current candidate he surely knows the CSD criteria. <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Guanaco&diff=8117415&oldid=8109703 Not much has changed> Sigh... Oppose. 
oppose,Oppose. 
oppose,Oppose due to the current Willy on Wheels debacle. The silly <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Vandalism_in_progress/Willy_on_Wheels poll> reads like something Iasson would write. I quote: "Votes for a hard ban will count toward a soft ban and votes for a ban of longer duration will count toward a ban of shorter duration." 
support,Extreme nominator support 
support,warmly. Have previously been impressed with Guanaco's admin work and have no doubt he will perform again. 
support,He has been an admin with no problems in my part of the encyclopedia to my recollection. 
support,Ground floor. 
support,He's been away long enough.
support,time to bring back this experienced user.
support,I believe people are capable of change as well. Give him another chance. 
support,support. About time too. 
support,Mopify every Zig. You know what you doing. Mopify Zig. For great justice. 
support,he has been an excellent admin before and will no doubt be an excellent admin again. 
support,Sure. 
support,it's about time he was given another chance.
support,with trepidation. Some people seem to be on a kick to rehabilitate banned users lately. That's nice if it works but the benefits to the encyclopedia are not all that great when balanced against the potential to dissipate our energies. Rehabilitating former admins strikes me as a much more useful proposition. Based on his comments here Guanaco has acknowledged and explained his previous conduct in a way that suggests he recognizes the problems with it. I hope therefore that these scenarios will not repeat themselves. 
support,Strong ; Guanaco made some mistakes for which he has apologized and has promised to work on. He's done a lot of good work both before and after deadminship. Let's not deny him adminship for something that happened nearly a year ago. 
support,did he do anything bad as of late? 
support,Let bygones be bygones. 
support,Agree with Snowspinner on this one. 
support,again. 
support,What he did wasn't even bad. 
support,albeit only moderately. I assume good faith on the part of this user and I'd give him a second chance. However... if events repeat I won't be as kindly with my vote. 
support,We should forget about his past mistakes (he has apologised for them) and move on. 
support,There is a lot to read here and after digesting the entire thing I see that I can think of no reason to not assume good faith. 
support,the kind of attitude displayed in the oppose votes below is why I rarely vote on RFAs these days. Forgive and forget I had one of my old account's userpage vandalized by this user but that was over a year ago! If we can't forgive then the core values of Wikipedia are comprimised and the vandals will have striked a major victory. 
support,Unquestionably. One of the old [[Ronin]] long time editor/admin. 
support,warmly a great Wikipedian he is. 
support,having read comments and assuming good faith
support,per Arktos. Guanaco's answers below seem adequate and sincere and I'm all for second chances. But I can understand that people want to see a few more weeks of problemfree editing so I look forward to supporting again soon 
support,I believe in second chances. I can't quantify whether or not he'll do these things again but Guanaco's responses below strike me as sincere. I don't think that the belief that he will be difficult to deadmin (if necessary) holds water: he was deadminned once and the second time will certainly be easier. Give the man back his mop. I for one trust in him enough that he will do well with it. It's time to move on: mistakes happen and it's pointless to keep a man in the mud after an apology and a promise not to do it again. 
oppose,Some comments from previous nominations don't bode well (" A loose cannon for a long stretch" "I do not want an admin to display this erratic behavior" "Has Guanaco done something terribly worthwhile or noteworthy that I've missed? I am weary of Guanaco's behaviour and maybe it has changed maybe not. But as hard as it is to deadmin people around here I'm not keen on finding out" "he needs to actually show a good deal of good behaviour before we trust him again" "Questionable judgment reckless unilateralism and refusal to admit mistakes are bad enough in an editor. Guanaco's behavior before his desysopping demonstrated why noone with these traits ought to be trusted with adminship" "as a candidate for adminship he marked his RfA for speedy deletion instead of withdrawing in the normal fashion" "Has repeatedly done dubious things in regard to admin powers and has often been recalcitrant when asked about them" "I believe that admins who are willing to take unilateral actionsactions which may or may not be in accord with the will of the communityshould be ready to explain themselves and discuss their reasonings when the inevitable questions arise. If their actions are repeatedly challenged they should stop. Guanaco did not to my knowledge show himself to be open to discussion of his controversial actions nor did he stop after several challenges from other users" "He frequently abused his privileges and acted with disdain toward community consensus. He makes no effort to "play well with others" and the ArbCom decision should be considered carefully" "He's unblocked users who there was consensus to block (such as impersonators) misused blocking powers in other ways he's unprotected pages without the slightest regard for what was going on on talk causing edit wars to unnecessarily restart and that's just what I can remember off the top of my head" "Admins should act with consensus and be held to a higher standard" "Guanaco seems to be a blazing loose cannon" 
oppose,Strongly oppose. I agree with Ambi above. User has a history of problems.
oppose,Per Ambi and per my comments the last two times around. &#8212;
oppose,we need to be tough on rogue admins imho. I expect to see a clear sustained pattern of excellent behavior before I'd consider voting support.
oppose,Strong Oppose per Ambi. Rogue admins are an increasing problem and readminning this editor would send a very bad message. Simply too little to gain too much to lose. 
oppose,Never Guanaco used to use admin privileges to protect trolls. I'm not interested to find out if he/she has gotten over that. 
oppose,Oppose due to concerns stated above particularly Ambi's. 
oppose,oppose per concerns above 
oppose,Changed my vote to oppose because of what I've seen. 
oppose,I'm quite willing to vote as if the slate was wiped clean after his last RfA. There's really only been two weeks of consistent editing since his last RfA in March (with sporadic edits in the interim). Given that it's a long difficult process to deadmin a user I'm going to need to see a longer period of good editing. 
oppose,Since his last RFA Guanaco has done nothing to change my opinion. (In fact it doesn't look like he's done much of anything.) 
oppose,Why should I support a candidate that tried to get his previous nomination speedy deleted and has since then accumulated only very few edits? Too little to gain too much risk involved letting Guanaco run amok again. We have much better candidates in line waiting for the mop. 
oppose,I am certainly willing to discount past issues and let bygones be bygones. However discounting his history I must note that there's hardly any recent history to judge him by as he made hardly any edits from april until the end of october. So I oppose for lack of activity. 
oppose,per Radiant and others. We seem to have have a nearly endless supply of good admin candidates who have no history of bad actions whatsoever... so why would we readmin someone whose major claimtofame is abusing admin privledges and getting deadminned for it? 
oppose,pretty much per what Radiant said but also because your characterization of the situation in your answer to question #4 below is pretty far from the mark. You weren't deadminned for blocking Cantus you were deadminned for consistently controversial use of admin tools. An answer that whitewashed indicates you don't really understand the problem. 
oppose,per reasons given above. With no usable way to deadmin people I have extreme reservations about giving the tools to those who've been known to abuse them. 
oppose,disagree with nominator that now is the time. 
oppose,Toughie. Second chances are definitely good. Proven abuse of admin tools definitely bad. So the question seems to be: "would he do it again?". This is hard to judge from recent edits; certainly some good RC patrol in there but also more reverting than constructing. <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Feminism&diff=prev&oldid=28351599 this edit> demonstrates he reverts rather quickly without reading the full extent of the edit. Tricky. But then my eye catches question 4: Deadminned for reverting one person after 26 hours? Judging from the answer on question 4 Guanaco doesnt seem to have gotten the jist (sp?) of the case against him. And how can you learn from the past if you dont acknowledge what went wrong? As such judging from the (admittedly little) information available the answer to the above question would seem to be: "he might". Hence I oppose. 
oppose,per Radiant. 
oppose,per Radiant. 
oppose,per Radiant. 
oppose,previous admins should have a higher bar than regular users and by that standard there is just too little to go on at this time. 
oppose,agree with Turnstep. If it weren't so hard to get something done about unaccountable admins it would not be such a big deal I think. 
oppose,Strong oppose to anybody who had a hand in the reinstatement of into the Wikipedia community. 
support,12:40 7 Mar 2005 (UTC). I support this nomination because I believe the English Wikipedia is enriched enormously by users who are not native speakers and/or are active on other language versions of this project. Without them I suspect the English Wikipedia would have an extreme bias towards the USA England and other Englishspeaking countries. Moreover the work of such users in copying translating and connecting articles across languages is invaluable in giving the project an internal cohesion so that it is a single project and not 164 different projects. It does appear that needs to get a clue or two about formatting but even my own formatting skills are not perfect after eight months as an admin. Give this user a chance. 
support,Agree with David Cannon. 
oppose,Agree with Carrp. I had to fix the self nom of the user to confirm with the guidelines of nominations. His user page is also pretty empty and his talk page has few comments two of which are in hebrew two are disagreements and one is my request for him to sign his selfnom. In general he does not seem to be familiar with the community or the policies and guidelines. 
oppose,Clearly not enough experience. 
oppose,lacks the necessary experience. 
oppose,Oppose for now based on lack of editing experience. 
oppose,Err... His response to 
oppose,Sorry but the user seems to want adminship too much (in a bad way). And to echo the votes above he needs more experience with disputes content policy and complex tasks. Maybe later. 
support,I am proud to be the first to support Halibutt. On the issues with which we have interacted (though I have not participated in the discussions mentioned below) I have seen him act as the mediator on a number of difficult topics in addition to his skills as a researcher and map creator. Even when we have disagreed (as has happened occasionally) I have found him to be both reasonable and persuasive and have learned a lot from his points. A great candidate for a mop. 
support,as above. 
support,Cue I thought he was an admin support! I've never had the opportunity to interact with him but I've been impressed with many of his edits. Should make a really good admin! 
support,Strong [[Image:Flag of Poland.svg|20px]]. Wikipedia potrzebuje więcej zdolnych białoczerwonych adminów. [[Image:Flag of Poland.svg|20px]] 
support,seems harmless enough. 
support,Seems like he would make a good admin 
support,good contributor with a good sense of humour.
support,Critics have raised legitimate concerns and I feel Halibutt has responded to them adequately. 
support,I have no problems with this user and the fact that he has enemies doesnt change that fact. Admin is no big deal!
support,Being Polish nationalist and stubborn in some cases are not very serious arguments against adminship. In my experience he respects serious arguments. IMO he is a pretty mature person and I don't expect him abusing the privileges which are pretty much limited and accountable by the way. 
support,Weak did not have to interact with him too much but overall looks like knowlegeable user I do feel some of his tendencies are not very good and infringe on other users but I do not believe he will ever misuse the tools or will he? –
support,Great contributor to Wikipedia. 
support,The scale of the contributions by Halibutt is quite impressive. True he has strong views on certain subjects and some of his actions were unconventional but this should not exclude him from adminship. If we were as a rule to exclude admins who made controversial edits we would be excluding many excellent Wikipedians. 
support,I do admit that Halibutt's statements and actions left me consternated at times (esp. in the context of the VfD against the "Polish Black Book" or in several naming disputes). However that was mainly against the background of a solid body of undisputedly constructive edits which easily qualifies him for adminship. 
support,There are times when Halibutt can be hardheaded during arguments but he should make a fine admin (and if hardheadedness was a stumbling block for adminship I'd have been deadminned ages ago!) 
support,To comment on some of the opposition I was probably the very first active editor on Wikipedia to challenge some of the site’s "Russophobia" so I understand where they are coming from. I am not a Russian nationalist or a Russian myself (I happen to be of Polish Jewish descent). But at times I felt compelled to do so because a counterbalance was needed in order to ensure WP:NPOV and no one else was providing it. Otherwise "Russophobia" is always going to be pervasive in an Englishspeaking online community because of the legacy of the Cold War. Therefore at times I have been in strong disagreement with Halibutt. But I was able to reach a understanding with him during our first encounter and all of my runins with him since then were quite cordial. Halibutt may have a strong point of view shaped by personal and family experiences with the oppressive end of Soviet and Russian imperialism but so what? Everyone has a point of view. Unlike the POV editors unsuited for adminship however Halibutt is able to work constructively with editors whose worldviews starkly diverge from his own and he is able to compromise. There are really no compelling reasons to oppose his nomination at this time. 
support,Although Halibutt can be involved in disputes (see Comments below) I have confidence that he would not abuse admin abilities. He is approachable productive and would be a worthy administrator. 
support,Strong views but willing to discuss productive reliable concerned with the project. 
support,as per 172. 
support,I watched Halibutt contributions in Lithuania and Vilnius articles and also have had discussions with him by myself. Halibutt has strong views but discuses them and accepts consensus. Also he is one of those who seems having strong ethics. I think he will be able to separate administrator duties from his POV so I trust and support him. 
support,Strong Strong character vivid views good editing
support,having and expressing strong views should not disqualify someone from becoming an admin. Unless it can be clearly demonstrated such views might interfere with their fair judgement. From all I've seen and read this is not the case with Halibut. So let's assume good faith and extend the mop to this fine candidate from the former Soviet bloc:>
support,What?! You seemed like one already! A committed Wikipedian definitely deserves the mop 'n' bucket. 
support,support 
support,If anything Halibutt (and especially Piotrus) have played a role in reigning in Polish nationalism on the [[Wikipedia talk:Polish Wikipedians' notice board|Polish Notice Board]] by encouraging the use of English there <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Polish_Wikipedians%27_notice_board&diff=18264983&oldid=18261255><http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Polish_Wikipedians%27_notice_board&diff=17892951&oldid=17892818>and moving opinions out of the project space and into talk<http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Polish_Wikipedians%27_notice_board&diff=15035464&oldid=15034971>. 
support,support 
support,support I am no longer participating in wikipedia activelly but I hope my vote counts. Halibutt adds valuable information to the site and I disagree with the accusations that his views would not permit him do adminship well in fact unlike some other users Halibutt is very able to understand opinions of other people and to go to compromises. As well he visits wikipedia often. I think he would thus do well as admin especially if he will not try to enforce his own opinions using his admin rights; I think however that he will not thus I vote in support of his adminship. 
support,I have not seen his nationality cloud his judgement at all. All it has lead to is insight from a different point of view which is needed for a true NPOV. Halibutt gets my full support. 
support,Like [[172]] ... Halibutt is a devoted and eager to help and discuss community member. I've observed a bit crusade against some Polish contributors and all this buzz and I don't really get it. It's very easy to accuse someone for nationalism because we all have some cultural background but it's really hard to fight with such an accusation. 
support,Who said an admin should not have and opinion of his own ? My first contact with Halibutt was our conflict on a town naming ;). Since then I've been meeting him frequently on many edits and respect him for his willingness to discuss and ability to reach consensus. Although he is a difficult opponent. I'm convinced of his strong ethics and am sure his adminship would be to the benefit of wikicommunity. 
support,Halibutt is dedicated wikipedian who contributed a lot of articles and is always able to reach and respect the consensus 
support,I've only interacted with Halibutt briefly but after that experience it is my belief that he's an open minded wellmannered and collaborative editor. Far from pushng single minded edits I've seen him mediate in disputes in which he could have easily sided with a particular position closer to his own personal beliefs yet he worked hard in order to achieve consensus and a neutral and encyclopedic agreement. I believe that highly qualified and friendly Polish users like Halibutt Piotrus Lysy et al should not pay for the questionable activities of a few another (and very different) users of the same nationality against which in fact they often intercede in pursuit of a true and scholar NPOV. </font color>[[Wikipedia:Esperanza|a</font color]]>
support,I second the comments above especially Haukurth. 
support,Nominator continuing support. In case there is any doubt as to were I stand... 
support,despite there are problems but IMO unrelated to adminship (see my comment in the "comments" section). 
support,I haven't read any of the above or below comments but in my experience Halibutt is both thoughtful and conciliatory. He has demonstrated that he respects Wikipedia and his position in the Wikipedia community. I am certain that he would do nothing to compromise that as an administrator. I hope that anyone who votes against Halibutt based on his dealings with me will consider that my vote here is support. 
support,–
support,as per . Her judgment is always enough to convince me.
support,I'm going to give him the benefit of the doubt here assume good faith and base my vote on his recent history. I remember the little brushfire over adding Polish names to German cities a few months ago but when I put that incident in perspective with his extensive good contributions and obvious dedication to the project I believe he will make a capable admin. 
support,Sure. – 
support,Nationalistic tendencies are disturbing to me the comments from my own nominator (dab) seem especially poignant relating to another vote I just cast. Still support votes from many editors whom I respect lead me to support. I hope to see the candidate refrain from administrative measures in areas pertaining to his/her point of view which has been my modus operendi here. With great trepidation. 
support,My favorite kind of editor (because it best promotes Wikipedia's purpose) is one who has a strong POV but knows how to compromise w/opponents and work toward consensus. We *need* these solutionoriented editors/admins on controversial topics. All that I've seen of Halibutt indicates he falls into this category. 
support,Change from oppose to support. 
support,People seem to think that if an editor merely has a POV then that automatically means he will be bias in every article he edits. This could not be further from the truth and Halibutt is an example of why. He may want to edit something to make sure the views of his side are correctly defined but he can still work with other people to make sure an article turns out NPOV. 
support,Is anyone not allowed to have strong opinions anymore or should we only have robots as administrators? I am surprised that an editor who has contributed so substantially is not an administrator yet so he gets my full support. 
support,From what I've seen . 
support,Has done a lot of good work on difficult topics. 
support,Seems to possess common sense; is simultaneously opinionated as hell and cognizant of the workings of NPOV. 
support,support I realize there is badblood against Halibutt and I cannot discern how much of it is deserved and how much of it is projection. In examining Halibutt's response here to his opposition I interpret that response as levelheaded collected articulate and wellthoughtout. Overall in reviewing random edits by Halibutt I think he's reasonable and interested in the health of this project. 
support,I think the accusations of "nationalism" are overblown just a bit.
support,Halibutt is clearly very dedicated to this project. Wiki will further benefit from his contributions in the adminship role.
support,He's a good guy 
support,his contributions to Polandrelated articles are great. 
support,he is neutral willing to discuss any changes and in wealth of information.
support,Strong He has greatly given insight into great articles such as that on Josef Pilsudski and [[Poland]] in general aside from that he has done many other worthwhile things for the Project. 
support,long time committed / clearly reasonably stable and knowlegable / has shown willingness to move towards a consensus he doesn't agree with (e.g. the proposal that Warsaw Uprising his "baby" should be split up). He does show patriotism. Taken too far I could have some problem with that. However after following some of the links listed elsewhere the accusations of nationalist (==racist/xenophobic probably including antisemitic/antirussian in the case of a Pole) behavior don't seem to be true and I specifically reject the use of the term as close to being a personal attack. I'd ask that he avoid being the admin that acts against Russians or Germans during disputes about pages involving Poland and its historical interactions with those other countries. 
oppose,Sorry but I don't think Halibutt is ready for adminship. He is a fierce Polish nationalist who takes pleasure in gratitiously bullying Russian editors. His Russophobic sentiments are too well known to enlarge upon it there. Just two days ago he declared that "if he speaks Russian drinks vodka and sings Katyusha he's a Russian" (see [[Talk:Russophobia]]). I don't think it's a proper way of admin's behavior. No need for further comments. 
oppose,Unfortunately Halibutt does have nationalistic tendencies at times if ever so slightly. I regret to not be able to support this otherwise productive contributor.
oppose,Absolutely not. Has no respect for consensus even when it's overwhelmingly against him. [[User talk:Cryptic|(talk)]] 15:34 16 November 2005 (UTC)<br />To be clear my opposition stems entirely from the dispute over [[Template:]] as mentioned below; I haven't encountered him in the main namespace. While I freely admit that my own handling of the situation wasn't ideal Halibutt's continual recreation of the template in the face of an 80%+ decision to delete on TFD shows that it wouldn't have made any difference.
oppose,The few times I've interacted with him he's made the impression on me of being a stubborn nationalist with a striking inability to recognize consensus. He was responsible a few months ago for bringing the Gdansk naming controversy to completely unrelated pages such as [[Mainz]] [[Aachen]] [[Dresden]] (see Talk pages) and even a large number of pages like [[Johannes Vermeer]] <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Johannes_Vermeer&diff=14748369&oldid=14745970>. This was in June but when he stopped he did so with the threat of starting all over again (<http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mainz&diff=prev&oldid=15253870>) when the consensus was clearly against him. And then there's the started by him which was described by some (IMHO accurately) as a witch hunt. 
oppose,Oppose. This user has an enormous amount of edits spread across the wiki but in going over the Template thing I unfortunately must oppose. Recreating any page six times (and never apparently going to VFU) shows very poor judgement. If there's one thing I can't stand it's calling vandalism that which isn't. This seems to be what the user did with the deleting admins who were looking at a valid G4 under CSD. I must also say the Polish Black Book is (ahem) idiotic. 
oppose,per Cryptic and Radiant. Much too controversial to be trusted with adminship. 
oppose,per Cryptic.
oppose,an edit summary for recreating a legitamately tfd'd template [[Template:]] "reinserted the template after User:ChrisO vandalized it." Calling it vandalism is just out of line and it was less than a month ago. 
oppose,Good editor but better safe than sorry. 
oppose,as per Ghirlandajo et al. 
oppose,oppose per Radiant. Everybody has a pov it is silly to require "only neutral" editors shouold be admin. However admins need to be capable of separating themselves from theirs when acting as admins and this is more difficult the more unshakeable your own convictions. Halibutt doesn't convince me he is capable of this. Nationalist editors are a scourge on Wikipedia and I will only support adminship of nationalist editors who have proven again and again their aboveaverage skills at civility fairness soothing effect on their more radical peers capability of seeing the other side etc. etc. The "support template" thing alone is sufficient to show that Halibutt is not very strong in these areas. 
oppose,oppose per radiant. 
oppose,oppose. Halibutt doesn't seem neutral and objective most of his editings are being made from ultraconservative Polish poitn of view and aim at whitening the Polish nation. This is not a basis for being an admin. 
oppose,oppose. Halibutt bullheadedly went and moved [[Antitank rifle wz.35]] despite several failed attempts to achieve consensus for the move. He showed no respect whatsoever for the [[Wikipedia:Requested moves]] procedure. 
oppose,Between his actions regarding <nowiki>[[Template:]]</nowiki> (less than a month ago!) and various Polish nationalist axegrinding over the Gdansk/Danzig notices (demonstrating a certain contempt for consensus) and the Black Book page I gotta say no. And if it's "no big deal" to be made an admin; well then it's no big deal if you're NOT made an admin ennit? 
oppose,Halibutt is a great editor and a "reasonable" patriot (compared to many others). All the more it hurts me to see all this controversy an enourmous handicap for a new admin. Also he doesn't seem to have the traits an admin needs to work properly. 
oppose,Halibutt is not admin material. He makes mostly good contributions but he has also generated lots of trouble for the community by means of [[WP:POINT]] leading to revert wars merely to demonstrate a point. I am worried about having him pushing [[WP:POINT]] with admin powers and cannot support his adminship 
oppose,per Ghirlandajo. 
oppose,I'm sure he would do some good work but too many things (the support template and the "Kb ppanc wz.35" debacle in particular) put me off. Sorry. 
oppose,We all have biases but episodes such as the repeated recreation of the support template leave me concerned that the editor's strong opinions are not sufficiently controlled. I hesitate to grant administrative powers to candidates such as these and the great difficulty in removing administrator status recently exemplified by the stillinprogress [[WP:RFAr]] case leave me wary. The difficulty in persuading him to delete the "black book" is also troublesome. Finally the nominator's campaigning on the Polish Wikipedia and recent unblock warring leave the candidate without the traditional confidence usually granted by support of a longtime or wellrespected editor. [[User talk:Knowledge Seeker|দ]] 04:43 20 November 2005 (UTC) I should add that it appears Halibutt is a highquality and prolific editor and I thank him for the hard work he has put into Wikipedia. My opposition now will not preclude me from supporting in the future should the current concerns be addressed. Deletion of the black book was a great step. 
oppose,Oppose. Eugene van der Pijll refers to Halibutt's "widening" the Gdansk dispute but I'm not sure he really indicates <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&target=Halibutt&offset=20050607&limit=300|the scale of it>. About 200 edits purporting to apply the results of the Gdansk vote (admittedly highly problematic in itself but that's another day's work) to some pretty unrelatedlooking articles including at least one 3rr violation in the process and ignoring repeated attempts to desist. This seems as clear an example of [[WP:POINT]] as one could wish to see (or rather be dismayed at) and one I wouldn't care to see replicated with the use of the extra buttons. 
oppose,per reasons already given. 
oppose,For all the long and defensive commentaries towards oppose votes. If he can't handle criticism during an rfa no way he's going to be able to handle all of the hassles that go with being an admin. 
oppose,Cześć! Tak? Nie? Nie. dzienkuje. There's more than enough evidence on this RfA alone to suggest that the user's temperament is currently not suited to admin status. 
oppose,False accusations of vandalism are unacceptable. 
oppose,For all the reasons given mainly the Black Book and also because of the many responses from Halibutt to the oppose votes. People should be allowed to vote against without being confronted. 
oppose,No (<http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Halibutt&curid=3173230&diff=29059996&oldid=29057773 personal attack removed>) 
oppose,Handling of 'support' template issue demonstrated poor judgement. 3RR violations over naming disputes also are troubling. If he keeps his nose clean I could probably support his next RfA—particularly now that the Black Book is finally gone. 
support,Alright here we go. Harro5 is a good user. Good luck! 06:23 26 May 2005 (UTC) Even with the prank (see comments) I will maintain support. 
support,Your work and interactions with other Wikipedians look good. I have one suggestion however: please remember to always use [[Wikipedia:Edit summary|edit summaries]]. 
support,Cool. 
support,I can't see why not. 
support,although I understand concerns of 'too early'. 
oppose,too early. 
oppose,Too early. Contribs list shows that he's a dedicated editor and active "behind the scenes" in the Wikipedia namespace (which is good) but also that he hasn't quite got the hang of policy in those pages. Also seems a bit pushy WRT speedy deletion. Try again later. 
oppose,A valuable user but I don't want to hand over the keys to speedy deletionmany of his nominations are clearly not speedy candidates (see e.g. [[small penis humiliation]] or [[Michael Collins (Irish patriot)]] which should have gone to Vfd and Rfd respectively. Every admin needs to understand that speedy deletion is only for the specific cases mentioned in [[WP:CSD]]. 
oppose,Nothing personal I just don't think you've been here long enough. Also the comments by Meelar are worrying. 
oppose,Overall I think many of your contributions are valuable. Your recent vandalism of [[Melbourne Grammar School]] and poor judgement with speedy deletes and encouraging vandals shows in my mind that you need more time before being trusted with admin rights. 
oppose,for now. The time's too short and that "joke" too recent. The excuse below about assuming the joke would be quickly reverted and then forgetting to delete it yourself bothers me more than the joke itself (though quickpoll do people laugh at these jokes?). One can forget stuff sure but how can I put this if you put in a sneaky autofellatio redirect you need to make a note to go back and check on it. Set your PDA or something! 
oppose,Not enough edits and hasn't been on long enough. Try again in a couple of months 
oppose,oppose try again in a month or two. imho you need more experience here. 
support,I'll support you again. 
support,Neutral. While Harro is committed and does good RC patrol he is too lenient in dealing with articles. For example Harro uses the verify and userfy tags too much even when vanity is obvious (although I guess the article will be deleted soon here is a diff: <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Murdoch_Wilkinson&diff=prev&oldid=17820133>). This leniency concerns me although i'm willing to be convinced to support here. 1 July 2005 19:59 (UTC) now although if the adminship passes i'd like Harro5 to be more bold in speedying vanity. 
support,A calm softlysoftly approach is always a good thing. 
support,though I voted neutral last time the only reason was because the "joke" (i.e. vandalism) was too recent. Now that time has passed I beleive Harro5 would make a good admin. | [[User talk:Flcelloguy|A note? ]]</font color>| 
support,active in FAC where I patrol mostly. 
support,Weak support. Good use of edit summaries good edits. My concern lies mostly with the fact that some editors would never do joke vandalism and also some of your actions show activity based on a lack of knowledge. (For instance [[Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Jehovah's Witness Cooperative Alliance|here]] you voted to delete based on a false premise (you seemed to think this was a JW organization when a cursory glance at the talk page showed it was an antiJW organization). That's just one example where I remembered running into you. Mostly good job; just be sure to use your judgement and it has improved substantially since last time. 
support,He seems responsible enough. 
oppose,Seems to me that most of the opposevoters on his previous RFA do so because of Harro's lack of experience. In my opinion that means he should not renominate himself so soon thus oppose. 
oppose,Too soon since last nomination. Will consider in the future. 
oppose,Immature <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Melbourne_Grammar_School&diff=14403132&oldid=13969895 vandals> make poor admins. Try back in a few months when you have someone respectable to nominate you. 
oppose,Vandalism does not stablish a good background for candidates. You shoud wait at least a few months before applying for adminship again. 
support,since I am nominating him.
support,an authority in Norse matters great contributor and Wikipedian. 
support,I know this editor personally and I am certain that he will be a dedicated and reliable admin. I also think the history of his actions on Wikipedia recommend him highly. 
support,Good at what he does.
support,We really need people who work in a peteculiar field and improve it dramatically its a lot better than a guy who checks 50 pages a day for grammatical errors or for linking. 
support,Quality work veteran user absolutely trustworthy. 
support,much needed type of editor. 
support,Patman2468 needs to be nicer to the WikiGnomes though. 
support,Not much quantity but certainly quality. 
support,[[WP:ESP|e]]
support,seems to definitely be worth of sysop rights. This editor will be a welcome addition to Wikipedia's administrative team no doubt. 
support,Wiglaf's endorsement is usually enough to convince me. But Haukurth's contributions in quality and quantity seal the deal this time.
support,Looks like a fine candidate. 
support,happily. 
support,I thought $USER was already an admin. 
support,Maintains friendly banter while revertwarring. 
support,changed vote I don't know what's going on but I just don't really remember doing the vote on this. I think I was thinking about a different user when I did this. You should be an admin you'll do just fine. 
support,From what I've seen Haukurth argues patiently politely and rationally even in the face of unpleasant opposition. A user with this disposition cannot go far wrong with adminship. Frankly I think the "oppose" votes based on the Amalekite affair are a little petty (politics yuck) and not relevant to this adminship. While not wishing to dig all that up again Haukurth was opposing a ban which seemed to have at the beginning been imposed outside of the provisions of banning policy. For Haukurth to have argued that admins should act according to policy is a tendency we should encourage in admins and is certainly not a sign of bad judgement. 
support,&#8212;
support,Good man. 
support,Extreme Loki > Thor User checks out good and I like what I see. 
support,I also strongly support Matt Crypto's and Haukurth's point of view in the block controversy. I believe the blocked user was respecting policy and acted in good faith. 
support,Strong his honest opposition to a wrongful yet popular and "feel good" block despite the powerful clique lobbying for it was a breath of fresh air giving me a renewed respect for the wikipedia and those who edit it. If he isn't admin material no one is. 
support,Strong Haukurth has not only proven to be willing to defend his views politely and completely in the face of withering criticism and unlike several others here he's also been very consistent in his view that adminship grants him no super special judgement powers to permanently ban or unban someone without a full discussion of all the issues involved. His repeated expression of willingness to defer to the consensus view on Wikipedia is proof that he's already better at this than anyone could reasonably be expected to be in order to qualify for adminship. Regarding the Amalekite issue there is absolutely no excuse to deny adminship to someone for arguing their views politely and fully as long as they've proven willing to yield to consensus in the end which is exactly what Haukurth did. Modesty in use of power even in the hypothetical case is to be commended. Further no single admin or admin candidate can ever be held responsible for being proactive in blocking an "Amalekite2"; whichever admin first finds the threat to be credible will make the initial block and then we'll have our discussion starting there. We cannot deny adminship on the hypothetical that he wouldn't be the first. It is foolish to deny adminship based upon a hypothetical situation as if he would be the only admin on Wikipedia because we've never demanded admins all hold a single view on blocking; in fact I thought (until I saw some of the opposition on this RfA) that we encouraged them to think for themselves... 
support,I firmly believe in (and have personally witnessed!) this user's devotion to Wikipedia its quality and neutrality. 
support,To me Haukurth's stand on the Amalekite issue is an extremely good reason to support him becoming an admin. We need more admins like Haukurth who think about the issues and are ethically responsible. 
support,I believe one's vote at RFA should be based entirely on one's belief as to the user's future behavior as an admin. Nothing I have seen or heard (even reading all the below) gives me any indication that will abuse admin functions. Voting as a 'protest vote' because of a user's opinions and arguments is against the spirit of this IMO. 
support,Free speech for everyone including Nazis. I also defend your right to knock them down for it pace Johnson. The rules apply equally to everyone including Nazis. Anything else is a step down the path to their world and I don't want that. I'm astonished to see some of the names of those who do. I don't think Amalekite made a threat although I can understand that some found his list threatening. It's alarming though that we are to have a political test for editors although again it's understandable that some want it. I don't feel it's fair that Haukur should be denied adminship though because he made a spirited defence of what he takes to be the values of Wikipedia. It's very sad that he is opposed for disagreeing with other editors but that's how it is here. You go with the herd or you're punished and we're calling that "consensus" these days. 
support,seems to be a reasonable candidate for adminship. 
support,His stand on the Nazi blocking issue was a sign of integrity. It takes a lot of integrity to defend someone you disagree with and whose views you find repugnant for the sake of fairness. 
support,based entirely on the observation that the nominee has kept a level head and pleasant attitude in the face of criticism and provokation on this page. He appears to respect Wikipedia policy and a NEUTRAL point of view in Wikipedia despite clearly having his own POV (as do we all). 
support,Need more admins. 
support,Eth and thorn are English and the blocking issue discussed below is a matter of valid difference of opinion hardly poor judgment. 
support,Suppport It's his coolness under fire that impresses me. He argues his views reasnably enough though I don't entirely agree with him. 
support,The wikicliques are opposed to this one in near unison so he must be doing something right! 
support,Although it's a little late to do so a reading of the sincere and deeply held votes of opposition with which however I strongly disagree convinces me that I should support this candidate. He is entitled to his views on orthography with which I disagree. I find myself in agreement with his moderate approach to the amalekite affair and I think this shows a man who can trust his own judgement and remain true to it in the face of opposition. I don't see many strong admin candidates these days; this is one of the few. 
oppose,Pushes page moves to nonEnglish titles with nonEnglish letters. Has too much of an agenda to have article names conform to ancient nonEnglish spellings. Not willing to give him admin powers to move pages. 
oppose,Strong Oppose on account of the Amalekite/Stormfront issue I cannot support a user for adminship who does not seem to see the need for Wikipedia to be proactive in protecting editors against offWikipedia threats based on their Wikipedia activities. OffWikipedia actions which could amount to physical harm being done to editors is grounds for permablocking. If you can't see that a neonazi posting a "hit list" of Jewish Wikipedians to a neonazi board as deserving of sanction I don't think you have the judgement to be an admin. 
oppose,Strong Oppose. I was not going to vote at all but I concur with Guettarda who insightfuly brought to my attention that I should voice my protest against Haukurth's actions during that affair here and that it is in fact important wrt to his compotence as a prospective admin (though I do trust him to not violate policy in a procedural sense is what I mistakingly had in mind as per my hitherto position). 
oppose,Strong oppose. It's not that Haukurth disagreed about Amalekite it's the vehemence with which he did it. I lost count of his posts to the mailing list and to talk pages. He also stated that he found Amalekite's posting of a list of editors believed to be Jewish to a Stormfront forum "amusing" rather than offensive. 
oppose,Strong oppose. Above Guettarda wrote "If you don't see that posting on Stormfront as a danger you show a serious lack of judgement. I don't think you're a bad person the thought of you unblocking Amalekite never even crossed my mind. It's a matter of trusting your judgement past experience says I shouldn't and your present comments say that my past impression is still valid" and I share this view entirely. That Haukur Þorgeirsson would respond to G by writing "The post was clearly silly semidelusional and in very bad taste I don't contest any of that. The only thing I don't think is accurate is that the post represented a real life danger to the people behind the Wikipedia user names" is enough proof to me that regardless of his intentions Haukur is naive reckless and dangerous. Above Matt Crypto writes that Haukur may have been offended as well as amused by Amalekite's posting (the fact that one of Haukur's supporters still doesn't actually know whether Haukur was offended or not itself speaks volumes). But given Haukur's most recent statement it wouldn't matter to me if he were offended as well as amused. Everyone has an excuse for being naive that is just our state prior to knowledge. I don't balme Haukur for initially not taking Stormfront seriously we all make mistakes. But for him to disregard the postings of several wellinformed and responsible editors for him to resist learning something new takes us from naivete to irresponsibility. And no Matt Crypto I am not trying to punish someone who has in other ways been a good contributer because he took an unpopular stance. Even if the stance were popular I would still object. It has nothing to do with it being popular or unpopular. It was a reckless and thoughtless stance regarding a very serious matter. 
oppose,Weak oppose. I mean just this side of neutral if the issue that's dividing opionion were a little less important that might have shifted me over into weak support. In most things I'd have little concern about Haukur Þorgeirsson being an admin; in fact probably in everything but the sensitivity to Wikipedians' safety (real or perceived) I'd be enthusiastic.<br>If someone had posted a list of say Flemish editors to a Walloon Web site and asked Walloon activists to watch out for a Flemish bias to Wikipedia I'd not have been overly concerned largely because Walloons are at worst a bit rude to their Flemish compatriots (and vice versa) and I should probably have taken Haukur Þorgeirsson's line. AntiSemites however do genuinely threaten the physical safety of Jews and to post to a list of people identified as Jewish to an antiSemitic Web site especially one that has all the hallmarks of being read by the sort of drooling cretin who might actually take violent action can't credibly even be dismissed as naïve. I'm concerned given the concerted assaults on Wikipedia from groups such as Stormfront at a failure to take such threats seriously. I have no doubt that Haukur Þorgeirsson is not himself racist in any way and the same is doubtless true of most of those who defend him on this ground but that's not the issue. Admins aren't meant to be Wikipedia's stanfing army or even police force but I'd hope that editors feeling themselves (with good reason) threatened by other editors should be able to count on us for support and help.<br>Again if Haukur Þorgeirsson had made the initial mistake but then had realised his error and apologised I'd have had no worries but it seems to me that he still doesn't really see the problem. He's been gracious enough to apologise for the way he expressed himself and for the impression that he might have given some people that he took racism lightly and that's good but there's no indication that if the same thing happened again he'd approach it with a different attitude (even if he expressed himself more clearly). 
oppose,for reasons listed above particularly those regarding his responses to the Amalekite incident. 
oppose,While he might not unblock Amalekite there will eventually be an Amalekite2. 
oppose,per Guettarda and El_C. [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
oppose,per SlimVirgin. I have concerns about him rationally handling NPOV situations as he has previously ardamently supported inclusion of neoNazi POV. Encourage him to remain an editor but not an administrator on the site. 
oppose,for reasons stated above. Someone can be an extraordinary editor on certain subjects but still how poor judgment on issues that admins deal with. We have enough marginal admins to begin with; we don't need more of them. 
oppose,for reasons stated above. 
oppose,for reasons of ethical integrity and Wikipedia’s academic credibility. 
oppose,per Guettarda and Olve. 
oppose,good editor but judgment concerns me.

oppose,Oppose. As per Slim Jay and Olve. 
oppose,per above discussion. 
oppose,per above discussion. This was poor judgment. 
oppose,Strong oppose per reasons stated by others opposing. 
oppose,Oppose. 
oppose,I have to change my vote again to weak oppose. From the developing discussion it seems clear that Haukurth still doesn't understand the danger of Amalekite's actions and I find this very disturbing for reasons I've stated above. 
oppose,That's all I'm going to say on this editor. – 
oppose,per above.&larr;
oppose,because of the Amalekite incident.
oppose,Strong oppose per SlimVirgin 
support,I trust Hedley to be responsible with his powers. 1500 edits is not that low at all and really I think that edit counts is a poor way to measure adminqualities. 
support,Yep. 
support,Cool. 
support,His apology and clarification shows that this user is responsible and his edits show he is dedicated to the Wikipedia. 
support,active and useful editor. I don't even see any need to chew over what exactly his involvement was in the fake article business—whatever it was newbies have certainly been excused worse behavior. It's assumed that noobs haven't seen the wiki light. As long as Hedley became a trusty user after the incident which I'm convinced of just forget it. Extra points for the selfnom! 
support,Changing my vote to support.

oppose,Slightly . Personally I find Hedley's politics concerning some articles based on personal bias. 
oppose,I really want to oppose but I'm clearly biased due to my contact with Oh what the hell A qualified oppose. This user didn't get to a good start. <http://www.coolclarity.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=28458&st=40&#entry725024 This post> from an external forum suggests that the reason he informed Wikipedians of his fake articles was to get other users in trouble: he was trying to get back at certain people. Anyway I don't think he's been a member long enough and he doesn't have enough edits to his name. 
oppose,oppose for now. i'd like to see a few more months of activity with the community and the software. 
oppose,oppose for now. I have to wait and see. 
oppose,Before anyone dismisses this as simply being vindictive please read to the end my opposition is based on more than the vandalism incident. As has already been discussed Hedley and I (and others) were involved in a game on the CoolClarity message boards both of us made two or three vandalisms nothing more. About a month later I found that I had been blocked after Hedley decided that he needed to drop someone else in it to save his own skin. This is the text of a private message that I received from him on the CoolClarity message board on 20th March: "If you want to know the whole truth in this PM I was just trying to impress the big guns in the Wikipedia room by coming clean by adding Zakir Raman to VfD. When I supplied them the info on the link to here they noticed you and I guess I spoke to some strict admins about it because they put you up on the RfC. I don't intentionally mean to grass anyone up but I wasn't gonna say that on Wikipedia.. Thing is I didn't want to get a block so I was defending myself. No intention to be hostile toward you or anything but I was stuck in a situation where it was defend you and get blocked or go on the side of the admins and come away fairly clean.." I don't think someone who is willing to twist the truth like that to further his own Wikipedia career is suitable to be an admin. My other objections revolve around the two occasions that I have encountered Hedley while making edits on here. The first involves the page [[Nelson Piquet Jr.]] which I created in October. In March I was informed on [[User_talk:David_5000|my talk page]] by Hedley that "Hey your article Nelson Piquet Jr. was a duplicate of an existing article on him so i've changed it to a redirect. You'll find there was an article of more depth already at Nelson Angelo Piquet." Of course if you compare the history of both pages <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nelson_Piquet%2C_Jr.&action=history 1> <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Nelson_Angelo_Piquet&action=history 2> you'll see that Hedley was wrong: my page was there five months earlier when I questioned him about this on his talk page I didn't receive a response. The second issue is about the page for the racing driver [[Mathias Lauda]]. Hedley created the page with the incorrect title 'Matthias Lauda' but when I renamed the page he quickly reverted it to the incorrect version without checking whether he was correct. Again my questions went unanswered. These experiences make me think that Hedley is inclined to make comments and edits without checking his facts first I'm concerned that Wikipedia would give moderator powers to someone who acts without checking whether his actions are justified first. 
oppose,Reluctant oppose for now. Seems like a very nice person on IRC and does have many good contributions. I would like Hedley to stay involved. However past vandalism must be balanced by a long good history in my opinion and the history here while high enough to regard as a good contributor is just a little bit too low to balance yet for admin status yet. 
oppose,the incident being discussed suggests the user is lacking a a level of maturity that I would expect from an admin. 
support,Over 3700 edits all good. 
support,Privacy is not a crime. 
support,I would like to see more edit summaries but the blank user page doesn't bother me at all. Of course this is the opinion of someone with a blank user page (I'll get around to it eventually). 
support,Useful editor.
support,I do understand the neutral voters' sentiments but in my opinion this user's good faith wikiquette and hard work outweigh those issues . (and yes I am biased because I have a habit of not leaving edit summaries... sorry _) 
support,Not having a user page doesn't concern me. 
support,User page is unimportant. Edit summaries the other big concern are something to work on but no reason not to be a sysop. 
support,anonymity. Edit summaries and discussion page are far more important than a user page. 
oppose,No userpage. 
oppose,I oppose for a couple of reasons. I don't really care about not having a user page although I do find it a bit strange. I find the answers to the questions below either very short and uninformative or noncommitted. As Henrygb noted above it is "not something I am particularly concerned about." 
oppose,No userpage no edit summaries we expect Admins to account for themselves and activley communicate with others. 
oppose,Lack of edit summaries is worrying. 
oppose,I prefer admins who want to do admin tasks. Will support if and when user clearly wants to be an admin
oppose,Oppose. It pains me to oppose a hard worker. But thusfar I feel the lack of edit comments and the edit war discredit Henry. I'd like to see Henry work harder and try again another time. 
oppose,She may be a good writer but her conduct on [[WP:FAC]] at the moment is so incredibly unbecoming of an administrator that I'm gobsmacked she's even been nominated. 
oppose,Oppose per her comments on [[Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Hollaback Girl]] specifically <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/Hollaback_Girl&diff=next&oldid=30063398> <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/Hollaback_Girl&diff=next&oldid=30111749> <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/Hollaback_Girl&diff=next&oldid=30144561> <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/Hollaback_Girl&diff=next&oldid=30156143> and most of all <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/Hollaback_Girl&diff=next&oldid=30149227>. I might also mention that I find the general tone on this page absolutely hilarious and this is my second ever vote on [[WP:RFA]]. 
oppose,User has only been here since November 5. I also note a suspicion that this is a sock puppet or reincarnation of {{User|Winnermario}} <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Mel_Etitis&diff=prev&oldid=27580686> and I didn't like these comments. <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Mel_Etitis&diff=prev&oldid=27581863> <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Mel_Etitis&diff=prev&oldid=27582424> I've no idea whether the sock puppet concern is correct. Perhaps the candidate could comment. 
oppose,Oppose as far as I'm concerned a bit too little Wikipediarelated (MFD RFA RFD AFD etc) discussion. 
oppose,per Ambi and Talrias. I'm pretty taken aback that anyone would say what she did on the Hollaback Girl FAC much less someone who would like to be an administrator. Would have to see a good bit of effort toward being more courteous before I would support.
oppose,based on FAC behaviour and account age.
oppose,per links provided above illustrating user's conduct. Also the comment "when I want something I get that something" in <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/Hollaback_Girl&diff=30152955&oldid=30149227 this edit> gives me very serious cause for concern. 
oppose,; user behavior has been sketchy. 
oppose,please see my comment below to the standard question "do you feel other users have caused you stress"? 
oppose,Comments at FAC indicate editor is far from ready for adminship. 
oppose,Inappropriate behavior. 
oppose,per Telrias Diff #5 although the comment made me laugh think of "What Lola wants Lola gets" of course if it was directed at me don't think I'd be doing much laughing. 
oppose,Strong Oppose per all diffs. Inapproriate conduct and behavior on WP:FAC. 
oppose,On FAC she has been a helpful voter some of the time but when her own issues and articles are at stake she seems to have an inappropriate temperament. This is a specific issue as the ability to keep one's poise when one's favorite issues and articles are edited/deleted/rewritten is important when one has the revert delete and move powers. 
oppose,per all 
oppose,pretty much per all but in particular because of the candidate's thoroughly inappropriate position regarding copyright violations and plagiarism. 
support,as nominator. 
support,Strong He has some nice edits and is an allround asset to Wikipedia that would be better as an admin. 
support,Edit Conflict with the Mistress because he does good work but in the future please use edit summaries more often okay? 
support,with similar stats to me how could I vote any other way .
support,He looks deserving to me. 
support,Awesome dude. <font>«
oppose,vote spam in #wikipediade #wikipediafr most probably in more channels. This is a nono. 
oppose,dito 
oppose,dito 
oppose,oppose 
oppose,oppose 
oppose,oppose 
oppose,strong oppose Not only was this user advertising he made it blatantly clear in the vandalism IRC chat that he didn't even fully read through the pages one is supposed to read through before nomination to become an admin via asking questions about the process he would have known the answers to if he had read the necessary materials. 
oppose,Recent edit summary usage seems to be well below 10%. Although I'm admittedly unaware of the context some of his comments (taken at random within the past week or so) seem to exhibit a sharp lack of objectivity: <{{fullurl:User_talk:Zmaj|diff=28521041&oldid=28520599}} Greater Croatian propaganda> <{{fullurl:User_talk:Zmaj|diff=prev&oldid=31747599}} "Why are you making such a noise...?"> <{{fullurl:Talk:Cazin|diff=prev&oldid=32103110}} loss of temper> <{{fullurl:User_talk:Rama|diff=prev&oldid=31311270}} deceipt and ban>. Unfortunately I don't think he'd use his administrative powers wisely; if he improves on these points I see no reason to oppose in any future request. // 
oppose,Low use of edit summaries could use more work in the Wikipedia: namespace. 
oppose,strong oppose I think this user is a hardline Serb nationalist. He used to vandalize many articles that are related to Bosnia and Bosniaks Montenegro and Montenegrins and Kosovo. He lied several times about my contribution saying that I edited some articles that I never did. For instance he said this: I am an goodf (at least I think) historian and am currently rewriting the articles of [[Doclea]] [[Zeta (state)]] [[Rascia]] [[Travunia]] [[Zahumlje|Zachlumia]] and [[Pagania]]. is changing those articles. That would vandalism if he didn't actually think that way. 19:44 24 November 2005 (UTC)<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Rx_StrangeLove Here>.But I have to say that I have never visited [[Rascia]] [[Travunia]] [[Zahumlje]] and [[Pagania]] articles. As you can see above he said: " is changing those articles." He was blocked for breaking 3RR and also tried to brake 3RR asking other user [[User_talk:Obradovic_Goran]] to help him in his nationalistic behaviour. He wrote this: Pih I need to ask you for another favour: History of Bosnia; vandal User:Emir_Arven has (unexplainingly) deleted my edits. Please revert the vandal's change to my last (<4>) I cannot it would be 3RR violation. The vandal just said "yes" and deleted important info. HolyRomanEmperor 17:05 3 December 2005 (UTC) So I think this user should be blocked because he lied and tried to manipulate with administrators about my contribution. 
oppose,Lack of edit summarries and lack of wiki namespace edits. Sorry 
oppose,The user can often be friendly but simply is not someone I or many others would trust as an administrator. His edits are virtually exclusive to topics of interest to Serb nationalists and he's been involved in countless edit wars throughout his career. He's flooded the talk pages of numerous users from the region including myself with countless questions about nationalist issues and then proceeded to give his own (controversial) views on the matter whether that person has responded or not. Many users have been bothered by this and consider it a provocation. Furthermore the user often displays bad wikietiquette. I distinctly remember that only just recently he lied to fellow users about me breaking the 3RR (when I didn't) in order to get me banned. 
oppose,Sorry Holy. As much as I may respect you personally you come with a lot of baggage and a constituency that would count on your admin status to push their agenda. Much more needs to be done in cooperation between our groups before I am comfortable to give you my vote and trust you that it will not be misused. Also for some of the reasons noted above: opposed.
oppose,You already know what I think. But it will be well to add in passing that you're throwing mud into Joy's face. 
oppose,It will provoke further conflicts and disagreements. He is known for his use of lies as arguments as i once saw. Evidence is his i dont know xy request for adminship. It will be disaster however. We don't need admins like that Wikipedia don't need that. It would be dissapointment for me and many others and failure for Wikipedia community. Yes he is good contributor but for adminship NO! He approaches sensitive articles to often and careless. 
support,Since this is a good contributor s/he certainly deserves some support. RC patrol is a very useful task if sometimes tedious. Keep up the good work and you will be an admin in a couple of months. 
support,I know there are low edit count problems but I will give the benefit of the doubt. 
oppose,for now. This editor is wellintentioned and likely to be mopworthy in the future. Not enough information available about how he interacts with other editors; most contributions in the User Talk namespace are {welcome} messages. Needs more seasoning in Wikipedia style conventions (his article [[Incomplete Pass]] was created with incorrect capitalization for instance). Would like to see more experience and interaction before we give the keys to an editor interested in heavy use of blocking and speedy deletion tools. 
oppose,Even though I'm normally against judging people on number of edits I have to agree that we don't know enough about his work so I'd say it might be better if he waited awhile to either self nominate again or be nominated by somebody else. Vote made by 
oppose,Sorry but it is too early. The edit counts are very low and there needs to be more interactions with users other than the welcome messages. 
oppose,oppose keep up the good work and renominate yourself in a few months. an admin should have a longer basis of experiences with the software and the community and the policies and the procedures. 
oppose,not because you have done anything wrong but becuase of a lack of experience. In fact you seem to be off to a very good start less than 1000 edits is too little... To paraphrase the <nowiki>{{test3}}</nowiki>template: Please continue. If you continue with your fine work you will be promoted to an administrator of Wikipedia. 
oppose,Does not meet . If you disagree and think that you do and would like me to reconsider please leave a note on my userpage 
support,You have my vote Michael Dobrowski 
support,My interactions with Howabout1 have been wholly positive. He has a keen interest in admin duties as exemplified by his answers below. I trust him. (For those opposed because this is his second selfnomination I will only point out that he did wait the customary month.) 
support,good job with RC patrol. 
support,Borderline . I was close to voting neutral on this one. However the friendliness shown to newcomers is a very good quality in an admin. I believe that you will use the admin powers wisely. 
support,I opposed last time due to lack of experience but I see Howabout1 has continued making good contributions and I feel that he will make a good administrator now. 
support,Now that my RfA is over and I haven't seen any evidence of serial killer tendencies I say give him the mop. 
oppose,Oppose. I apologize but with an edit count less than 2000 only six months contributing and the fact that I have never seen you before I cannot really support you. 
oppose,Sorry no. This is not particularly about your dispute with me over your proposal for disruptive users. I simply think you lack the maturity to be an admin. 
oppose,This editor is trying too hard to become an admin. Will support if not a selfnom. 
support,Although I don't recognise the nominator I'm going to vote support this time too. 
support,as per last time. 
oppose,Oppose in the strongest possible terms. Editor is trying way too hard to become an admin. Nominator didn't sign the nomination which is questionable and I don't recognize the nominator as trustworthy. In fact it's quite obvious that put up to putting up the nomination solely in order to comply with previous requests that he not selfnom again. <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AAntiAnonymex2&diff=19412348&oldid=19412302> <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AHowabout1&diff=19528840&oldid=19520176> 
oppose,Although I supported last time I believe that such a quick renomination is silly. 
oppose,I am very surprised that the nominated user accepted two days after he had withdrew his selfnom. This is an abuse of process. I am sorry but his accepting this nomination tells me he will not make a good admin. It is doubtful I will ever vote for him now. He has my sincerest apologies. 
oppose,Abuse of process. Either you are serious about withdrawing yourself from consideration while you improve your resume or you aren't. Even if we assume there is no collaboration between you and the nominator then we are left to assume that you saw the only problem with the last nom was that you nominated yourself. Your excess of enthusiasm makes me wary. The fact that you would in effect game the system by allowing a vote to restart only two days after you closed a previously losing vote makes me question your judgment and pushes me over to oppose. 
support,as nominator. 
oppose,Looks like Imaglang has done some good work but I'd like to see more than 200 edits before I support a Rfa. With more time and edits I would support. 
oppose,Nice start. Come back after 3 months and 2000 edits 
oppose,Might make a good admin in the future but it's too soon for me to support until I see more edits interactions with other Wikipedians and the test of some more time. Agree with Blankenfaze. 
oppose,20 article edits... 
oppose,What they said. 
oppose,Good user. But not at this moment. If you come back with at least 1200 edits I'll probably support. 
oppose,Sorry but I'd like to see more experience. 
oppose,Looks like a great contributor but I agree with others needs more edit history. 
support,of course. 
support,as he's contributed lots of Hong Kong related articles and also the HKWNB and COTW for Hong Kong. 
support,Solid editor and writer. Opposition irrelevant as he states that he will not exercise any admin powers in PRC and ROCrelated disputes. 
oppose,and very strongly too. While it is not expected for all admins to have a NPOV in all issues his conduct when it comes to dispute resolution and naming conventions has led to a record of one RFC <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Instantnood> and two ROA <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Instantnood%2C_et_al.> <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Instantnood_2> the later of which is still ongoing. Contrary to this claims he has proven himself to be critically inept in dispute resolution. Irrespective of the Arbcom's outcome I have little confidence in his ability to demonstrate maturity fairness and tact in his dealings and general conduct on wikipedia.
oppose,I'm supposed to be on [[Wikipedia:Wikiholiday|wikibreak]] now but I think I'll vote on this one. Instantnood has been involved in plenty of edit wars including some really trivial ones (should category HK literature be put under or merely linked to Chinese Literature? See [[WP:LAME]] for details). I just don't think he has the right temperament to be an admin. 
oppose,The behaviour of this user proves that he does not believe in consensus; in fact he'll either ignore it or try to get around it. I find it difficult to believe that someone who games the system by using carefullyspaced reverts to avoid 3RR or sneaks in controversial changes by marking them as minor would actually abide by his word and never use his admin powers on the one topic in which almost all his edits are. This is a onetrack editor with a clear POV and mission as proven 16000 times over. I will reconsider my vote if ArbCom clears him of any wrongdoing. 
oppose,Even if it wasn't me personally involved with many of his disputes I'd still oppose for the same reasons that Borisblue and OwenX detail and a thousand other reasons that a good look over the edit history reveals. 
oppose,involved in renaming controversies and other disputes I'm not sure that he would work harmoniously with others. There was an earlier RfC: [[Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Instantnood]]. 
oppose,per Curps. 
support,Count is low but distribution is nice. 
support,support. [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,Yes. A little early... OTOH would make a good admin so why not 
support,</sup/><p style="fontfamily: Bradley Hand ITC Comic Sans MS;">
support,He would make a good admin in my opinion. 
support,e He would make a good admin and is very hepful and cool (he is from South America like me too!).
support,He would make a good admin and is very helpful and trustworthy (
support,He helped get all my history back for my account. It was deleted before and now I have it back. thanks to him! (
oppose,I believe that this user has not been editing for long enough as a nonvandal. My standards state 3+ months and though I am willing to support those who do not meet them if they have other redeeming qualities I don't see enough in this user to do so. Additionally past history of vandalism gives me some pause. . 
oppose,Too few edits in too little time.May the Force be with you! 
oppose,too little experience. 
oppose,Sorry but 3 months is my magic line (except once).
oppose,per Andrevan 
oppose,It's not because of your past though. I trust that you have reformed. I've seen it happen before. But since you have only been productively editing since June 25 I've support you after September 25 as you get the good three months in there. [[User Talk:Acetic Acid|Acetic]]
oppose,I find it hard to support anyone with only two and a half months of quality edits. Past history of vandalism sets the bar even higher. (But you deserve props for being frank about it and reforming.) 
oppose,nice edit count but a very short time. 
oppose,Besides being a former vandal and taking off six months (I checked) your user page strikes me as being a bit uncivil. "Political s***" and "Kick "a** links" for headers just don't sit right with my understanding of [[WP:Civil]]. Yes you have been making reverts and helpful contribs but you're too selfcentered and absorbed to be an [[ambassador]] to new users of Wikipedia. My advice: become more civil in your use of the English language learn more new words in the language to help selfexpression and learn from more experienced respected editors here on the Wikipedia. Find an area of interest you don't know much about (other than bands and music) and learn and contribute to it. Then come back and see about adminship. I hope I've said this in a gentle constructive way. . . that's my intent here. Thanks for listening. 
oppose,Only ten weeks of good editing preceeded by a six month break preceeded by minor vandalism? What's the harm in waiting? Keep doing good editing use edit summaries each time for article edits and in a few months let's reevaluate for adminship after considering the friendly criticism above. 
support,Journalist does good work and I like his answers to the questions below. One little thing: please remember to consistently use edit summaries. 
support,meets . So long as he doesn't contribute like a jornalist... LOL! 
support,would make a good administrator. Journalist's contributions to Wikipedia have been impressive. 
support,already took above into account.... eeeexxxxceeeelllllent 
oppose,Too inexperienced in my opinion. May the Force be with you! 
oppose,Hasn't been here for very long. Only has 12 edits in the Wikipedia namespace. That shows you don't vote on RFAs very much. I don't think you should become an admin unless you take part in the process. 
oppose,Will support at 1000+ edits. 
oppose,work mainly on female singers doesn't follow or contribute to [[Special:Newpages]] or [[Special:Recentchanges]] VfD CfD Copyright Problems... For simple editing no admin powers are needed. Also a low editcount. 
oppose,Two months is much too short not to mention the lack of experience. 
oppose,Does not use edit summaries very frequently. Also I'm a bit troubled by some rapid {{tl|nonsense}} tags added today (August 22) to a couple of pages <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Thoughts_on_Various_Subjects%2C_Moral_and_Diverting&action=history> <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Weapons_Company&action=history>. I recommend the nominee add pages they think might be nonsense to their watchlist and come back to them when a user familiar with a given topic has had a chance to work on the article in question. If this user addresses these concerns and is up for nomination again after a couple of months have passed I will support. Everything else looks to be good. 
oppose,Oppose regretably. I remember feeling a similar way in June after I'd been here a month but I've learned since than that I simply hadn't had enough experience in wikiconflict to be a good admin. I'm sure you're a conscientious and helpful wikipedian but give it a few months please. If your contributions to the project remain so positive I will support.
oppose,not been on here long enough 
oppose,I hate to be a party pooper and I get no enjoyment out of casting an oppose vote. However I don't think you're ready yet. This is me talking from an administrator's stance: I don't think you've sufficently learned the ropes yet. I think if you learned how to apply applicable Wikipedia guidelines to your article edits you'd be much better off in the long run. Come back with improvement and I'll support you. | [[User_talk:Linuxbeak|Talk]] | 
support,Well I just support zis guy you know?

support,As per Radiant. I trust him to use his powers only for consensus never for evil. 
support,Disturbingly good with a mob and bucket. 
support,a good contributor who can definitely be trusted with speedy deletion. 
support,Strong I often find myself having an opposing viewpoint to Kappa on VfD but the user's civility has been noteworthy and the user is anything but triggerhappy with deletions.
support,We disagree on many things but Kappa should certainly be allowed to wield the mop and bucket. 
support,from me too. One of the more rational voices on vfd. 
support,This should be no big deal. 
support,Sure thing With Kappa all articles are safe.
support,Great user trustworthy and very helpful. As long as you're not a [[Kappa (mythical creature)|mischeivious water imp]]. 
support,Keep up the good work!
support,In general I don't like selfnominations but Kappa is a good exception to a general rule. 
support,strong editor. 
support,Sure; adminship is no big deal. | [[User_talk:Linuxbeak|Talk]] | 
support,extreme inclusionist We need balance or something. 
support,The votes opposing Kappa for adminship have spoken even more eloquently of his good qualities than those in favor. To call him an extreme inclusionist is simply incorrect. <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AVotes_for_deletion%2FAlisonfire&diff=14740578&oldid=14733019> <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Saga&diff=14732009&oldid=14731901> <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Www.chowk.com&diff=prev&oldid=14439289>.
support,Sypport 
oppose,Sorry I don't see enough substantial contributions to articles to merit adminship yet and the two articles cited as examples of his contributions are not much better than stubs. Willing to support in the future should this change. 
oppose,Extreme inclusionist. 
oppose,I agree with RickK and I also don't see much participation in areas outside the school debate and vfd
oppose,If there's a balance outside the schools/VFD vote I would like to see it. 
oppose,Sorry but I agree with the Oppose votes above and also note that two of the four things Kappa wants admin powers for seem to be housekeeping tasks that anyone can perform (delete copyvios and post "test" messages). 
oppose,Absolutely not: The reasons for wishing admin status ring false and Kappa routinely ignores existing deletion policy on VfD. One should not become an admin simply to try to pull articles out of deletion. You can already remove speedy tags already add content to articles to keep them from being speedies and already go to VfU and argue for restoration of improper deletions. Reaching into the deletion log and undeleting articles is not valid by anyone. VfU is required for every single one. 
oppose,I have the same concerns as mentioned by others here. I will also note that Kappa is extremely inclusionist on [[Wikipedia:Categories for deletion]] and [[Wikipedia:Templates for deletion]] and some types of categories and templates can be sometimes more disruptive to Wikipedia (in the sense that they affect far more pages) than many individual articles that are listed on [[WP:VFD]]. 
oppose,I agree with many of the concerns listed above. 
oppose,Does not meet . If you disagree and think that you do and would like me to reconsider please leave a note on my userpage 
oppose,I expressed concern earlier about Kappa's lack of response to his talk page. If he had addressed that matter he would quite possibly have persuaded me to support his RFA. However as he hasn't responded to it I feel I have to oppose as I think communicating is a very important part of adminship. 
oppose,Oppose. Either pushing an agenda or simply a troll. Routinely wastes other peoples' time with frivolous VFU nominations. 
support,one of our most dedicated editors. 
support,agree with nominator. ;) 
support,Very strong support very strong and dedicated editor and highly unlikely to abuse his powers. I see no reason that being an "inclusionist" as a bad quality in an admin. [[user:Celestianpower|Cel]][[WP:ESP|e]]
support,16000 edits is more than enough. 
support,support 
support,[[Image:Wolverine on rock.jpg|25px]] with my pack of wild wolverines While Kappa is a bit too inclusionist for my tastes politics is no reason to keep a qualified candidate out of adminship. I see no evidence that he will for instance go around doing rogue undeletions. 
support,per BD2412 and Hall Monitor. Hardly likely to abuse powers. 
support,we're on opposing sides of the inclusionist scale and I still respect his viewpoint and carriage. Would make a great admin. 
support,hopefully Kappa changes his mind... he'd make a good admin. 
support,and sincerely hope that he reconsiders his declination. 
oppose,It looks like the main reasons that Kappa's nomination failed last time were his excessive focus on VFD and his strong predictable and often perplexing inclusionist streak. I don't see that this has changed as he still seems to spend an inordinate amount of time on VFD and I still personally think that he votes to keep many things that seem like clear candidates for deletion to me (i.e. [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/QuiGon Jinn 12" Inch]]). Sorry. 
oppose,Weak Oppose There is nothing wrong per se with an inclusionist streak unless it leads to frivoulous editing such as his [[:Category:Elf schools]]. Has in the past voted for keeping categories and templates that were so crufty that they verged on disruptiveness. I'm just not sure I trust his judgement... Others do have other opinions however.. 
oppose,Oppose with caveat: While I agree that Kappa is worthy and I certainly have no objections to an inclusionist I'm concerned that it looks like he's being forced into this vote when he's reluctant. I don't think people should be forced to be admins if they don't want to be so unless there's indication that he's happy to be an admin I'm opposing. 
oppose,If he doesn't want to be an admin don't make him one. [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
oppose,While he's a good contributor Kappa has issues with civility. When people disagree with him he is far too quick to make snide remarks or accuse them of bad faith or of breach of policy e.g. <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Falldown&diff=24080575&oldid=24079816> <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Information_Technology_Channel&diff=24074664&oldid=24072026> <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Desmoplastic&diff=23965704&oldid=23965534>. Also he seems to have a misunderstanding of CSD (<http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Votes_for_undeletion&diff=prev&oldid=23188415>) and has very little edits in Wikipedia namespace other than AFD discussions. 
oppose,per above. 
oppose,Strongly oppose: Same issues as last time. Few actual contributions to the body of the project constant campaigning on VfD to prevent deletion pretending that there is a consensus or even policy for his views when there isn't badgering people who nominate for deletion and vote for deletion. You have to either agree with the policies or agree to abide by them and certainly not misrepresent them to be an administrator of the policies. 
oppose,Would strongly support if candidate showed interest. 
oppose,Needs more experience with policy. 
oppose,till user sets an email id. 
support,Absolutely. 22:06 25 May 2005 (UTC) I'm a concrned with his responses and I note some of the comments bellow. Therefore I'm withdrawing my support vote which I may or may not reinstate. 00:37 26 May 2005 (UTC) With some pressing items having been clarified to my satisfaction (and also with the hopes that Kils will continue contributing to WP) I am restoring my support vote. 
support,SUPPORT. after much deliberation i believe that Kils did not make sock puppet oceanographer and i feel that Kils deserves another chance. 
support,I really had to do quite a lot of research on this one but I feel quite confident in my decision. The problem from 2003 is serious indeed but it is ancient history by wikipedia standards and the intervening two years without sysop status has been punishment enough. As far as the recent business with Oceanographer only Oceanographer knows for sure what's going on but I feel we should give Kils the benefit of the doubt. A student writing a vanity page for their professor is not unlikely... in fact it happens all the time! I'm inclined to believe Kils about that. 
support,Tentatively support. This one like what Starblind said was a tough choice. I looked through all the old records read Uwe Kil's response at my [[User_talk:Flcelloguy|user talk page]] and looked at his edit history. Though his count is overinflated because of his responses to users he does have over 1500 edits. Looking at his article edits he has contributed a lot of quality substance including multiple pictures graphs and data. Also I believe that he has learned from the past regardless of who is to be blamed. Note that the old logs claimed it was "temporary" desysoping (is that a word?); one year seems to be more than enough for a "temporary" period. Also we must give him the benefit of the doubt regarding the sock puppets... I'm sure there are kids out there who will do that. And the blanking of user pages? I'm sure that was a rash action that he won't repeat again. If he does though we can always desysop him again. One year seems plenty of time for a [[Wikipedia:Wikipedians|Wikipedian]] to regret his actions (presuming that he is responsible for those alleged actions). For now though we should give him the benefit of the doubt and readmin him. However this is only a tentative support no one opposing him has responded to my comment or has given a clear concise (one paragraph or less) view of why he should not be readmined (again is that a word? lol). If someone does (which would make it a lot easier rather than trying to piece together tons of different sources with different views on what happened) I will reconsider my vote and make another educated decision. Thanks! (Whew what a long support vote!) 
support,good Wikipedian. 
support,I'm concerned that if given sysop privileges again Kils will again use his position to remove articles that he deems offensive that being said I think that he should be given another chance. 
support,I'm afraid I wasn't here when this first controversy happened but I am willing to accept his statement that he will not abuse his powers. Furthermore having been involved in the Vfd (minorly) I really don't think those users are sockpuppets of himself. My support is only weak because I don't have firsthand knowledge of the previous controversy. 
oppose,Tentatively oppose. The timing is peculiar at best in light of <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&oldid=14261583#Oceanographer_and_Kils Wikipedia:Administrators' noticeboard/Incidents#Oceanographer and Kils>. While sockpuppets are not forbidden the fact that it played a role in his desysoping makes continuing use of multiple accounts worrisome. Also if Kils is returning to a greater level of activity and proposing to resume adminship I am concerned about his familiarity with present community norms. I'm not sure the answer to the third question below can be considered sufficient and I think we need Kils to elaborate a little more. 
oppose,The sockpuppet allegation is not good but I am also worried about this user's poor spelling and English (see his comments about his desysop and how he answers the Admin questions). 
oppose,Regrettably . Unilaterally "cleaning" wikipedia and removing the discussion it generates did not and does not inspire confidence for suitability as an admin. But don't take it too hard all the interesting stuff on wikipedia can be done by nonadmins; The flip side of adminship is no big deal is that not being an admin isn't that big a deal either. 
oppose,I am afraid. This user appears to take criticism too personally this makes me question whether he has the right mindset for adminship. Also I find his answer to question 3 if not dishonest is at least circumventing the truth I cannot support a candidate who does not operate with complete transparency. 
oppose,Something's fishy here (pun fully intended). 
oppose,Strong oppose. 
oppose,There's nothing specific I can point to but I don't have a good feeling about this person as an admin. 
oppose,Prof. Kils is very welcome to step up his contributions to this encyclopedia again but he doesn't need to be an admin to do that. I count exactly 83 contributions from Nov 1 2004 to May 22 2005 and basically no involvement with housekeeping tasks. I am kinda sorry that the old deadminning story keeps haunting him but he'll have to earn our (or at least my) trust again first. 
oppose,has already worded my feelings perfectly. 
oppose,I agree with . The current lack of involvement for the past few months does not convince me that there is a need to be promoted again. 
oppose,Vague oppose. I also had to do a lot of research on this (as I thought about supporting him) but feel that the benefit of the doubt should not be given. If anything goes wrong it will be difficult to desysop him again (for good). 
oppose,I'm a little worried about his English and more worried by his rather snappish responses to criticism. Reading through his replies I'm unable to work out what he means sometimes (e.g. "I am not [[user:oceanographer]] I made them") and if he can't keep his temper here when one would have expected him to be on his best behaviour then there are definite concerns more widely. 
oppose,I would have remained neutral on this issue but this users contradictory responses their comments on [[Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Uwe_Kils|vfd/Uwe_Kils]] and their replies to issues raised here all give me concerns as to their interpersonal skills and suitability for adminship. 
oppose,Responses on this page make me uncomfortable. 
oppose,While I appreciate Kmweber's recent articlespace contributions and vandalism reversion [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Escalator Productivity|this AfD discussion]] revealed some extremely radical views he has about policy: the idea of consensus is "flawed" and the core policies [[WP:V]] [[WP:NOR]] and [[WP:NOT]] are somehow invalid. I also recall some bizarre idiosyncratic edits regarding [[Mojo Nixon]] a while ago that some might consider vandalism: <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Elvis_Presley&diff=prev&oldid=15434492> and <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Michael_J._Fox&diff=prev&oldid=15427586>. Note the edit summaries which are "spelling corrections" when the edits are anything but spelling corrections. 
oppose,per . 
oppose,As an admin one must act on consensus sometimes ferret out what might be consensus instead of making policy. I had no problem with curtness or the occasional outburst in several recent admin candidates but the statement "'consensus' is as flawed as the policies it creates" in [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Escalator Productivity]] convinces me that will push an agenda. 
oppose,The statementvergingonmanifesto above makes pretty plain that Kmweber has an agenda that he will likely push. Being an archinclusionist is fine (if a little unhealthy) but not then reinterpreting policies to meet those ends. As for suggesting that deletion is a form of vandalism well it is hard to be more wrong; it is merely cleaning up. Even if an agenda wouldn't be pushed the interpretation of policy leads to some fairly clear judgement errors: On [[WP:VFU|VfU]] at present is [[The Olmos]] which prior to speedying said "A Yearbook of unprecedented quality." Kmweber has requested its undeletion "because it exists" (a largely unverifiable fact). To wanting to undelete as a result of VfU well VfU undeletes (at a stab of a guess) an article a week or so so you'll get little catharsis there. I'm also given to understand that Kmweber is kicked from the IRC channel fairly regularly which must mean he can be more than a little irritating at times. Finally there's that spate of vandalism quite recently (in RfA terms) when I took a resulting article to VfD you can guess what sort of accusations were left on my talk page much the same as those regarding deletion above. If you're just after the rollback button Sam Hocevar's <http://sam.zoy.org/wikipedia/ Godmode lite> will give you that 'for free'. 
oppose,Kmweber uses misleading edit summaries to mask vandalism <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Joan_Rivers&diff=15519882&oldid=15420831> doesn't respect consensus <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AKmweber&diff=18422244&oldid=18411054> and declared that "I derived no value from performing mundane tasks that were MUCH beneath me in "cooperation" with what were mostly utter incompetents who had no respect for the creative power of the human mind" <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AKmweber&diff=18439838&oldid=18423232>. So far Weber seems like a [[Wikipedia:Role account]] enacting his interpretation of Ayn Rand's philosophys most notably that consensus opinions are weak. Extremely unstable horribly unsuited for adminship. 
oppose,per above. 
oppose,Bandwagon. 
oppose,as per vandals shouldn't be editors not to mention admins
oppose,per above. </sup/><p style="fontfamily: Bradley Hand ITC Comic Sans MS;">
oppose,too controversial for me. 
oppose,Please reconsider this stance that almost all deletion is vandalism. 05:07 24 September 2005 (UTC) Actually after reviewing the first link cited by DropDeadGorgias I'll change my vote to strongly oppose. That was sneaky vandalism. 
oppose,His comment that "all that has to be true for a theory to exist is for it to be stated somewhere" is bizarre in the extreme. 
support,Editor since Sept. 2003. Relatively low edit count but a diligent history of template maintenance. Seems a solid "janitorial" wikipedian and we need the cleaning around here. 
support,template editors should be able to be admins. There is room for them and I don't see that as a reaosn for an oppose vote. Seems arbitrary to me. Wii edits aren't any more better or more important than template edits when being an admin is no big deal. Could use an admin like this user.
support,Solid and trustworthy worker. 
oppose,Oppose. Edit summaries are basically nonexistent. This plus just 7 wiki edits (looking through contrib's there is little diversity generally) is enough to oppose. The work in templates is excellent though and the user seems to want to help. Use summaries and move around the wiki and you get support next time! 
oppose,7 wiki edits are Way too few. Try editing more in AFD and RFA and u will get my vote next time 
oppose,Weak Oppose Wait a few months. Good attitude and the CSS knowledge will ensure approval then but right now I think he's a bit too unseasoned. 
oppose,per . 
oppose,Looking through your contributions it seems that you made your first edits on 27 September 2003 then one edit on 4 October 2003 9 edits on 9 November 2003 17 edits during December 2003 and then nothing for six months until you returned in late May 2004 and were very active through to 26 July 2004. You then took another break and didn't return to active editing until 2 April 2005 where you then edited through to 26 April 2005. It seems you then took another long break until 10 September 2005. However from that time through to now I'm glad to see that you have been active and have done some great work on the succession templates. <br> However the reason I oppose at this time is for you lack of edit summaries of which they are the exception rather than the rule. The other reason I oppose is your current lack of communication with other users and your current lack of edits in the project namespace. <br> Please don't feel disheartened by my vote. Get yourself involved in the project namespace remember to always write an edit summary and continue to actively edit over the following months and I will gladly support your nomination. 
oppose,I couldn't have said it better than . Keep up the good work and please work on your weaker areas. 
oppose,per Ianblair23. 
oppose,Oppose. I have no memorable interactions with this user but the fact that he listed his nomination in the wrong place <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship&curid=246057&diff=19581843&oldid=19572157> has voted for himself (which is... unorthodox) and has made many typos and errors in his acceptance and answers shows a lack of familiarity understanding and respect for the process. Furthermore. I would think that an admin should at least make sure to read the instructions on a page follow conventions and be meticulous with editing particularly for something as difficult as a selfnomination. 
oppose,Opening statement and answers to the standard questions do not indicate a familiarity with what administrators typically do. Managing [[Wikipedia:This week's improvement drive]] shows dedication but you appear to have litle experience doing adminlike activities (VfD and its counterparts vandalism reversion). The "checkered past" is also of some concern; elaboration on this would be most helpful. 
oppose,Weak Oppose primarily based on two things both from the acceptance message above: you've had twenty VfDed articles!? I mean one or two is okay but twenty? That strongly suggests that you're out of step with the sorts of articles should have. What sort of articles were they anyway? Also the part about "the power and the prestige (such as it is) of adminship" also rubs me the wrong way. I suspect that it was intended jokingly (hence the "such as it is" part)... though if that's the case why insult a position you're simultaneously seeking? 
oppose,Bunch of reasons. First of all 1700 edits is nothing for someone who has been here for that long. Plus 20 articles going to vfd is a ton for someone without that many edits. Like was said earlier one or 2 is ok but 20? Plus I'm not sure he knows what admins do. I would strongly suggest reading the [[Wikipedia:Administrators%27_reading_list|Administrators reading list]] so you have some understanding about what admins do. Reading the answers to the questions it sounds like the user thinks that being an admin is something you should be given for good deeds. It doesn't quite work that way. It's more of using it for things such as vfds or for conflict resolution. It isn't really a reward for goodness. You need to show that you will use the powers and use them well. And also the "checkered past" bothers me as well. I appreciate the honesty but that indicates a willingness to get into conflict. Admins don't have alot of powers but what they do have could cause problems in that kind of situation. 
oppose,per Starblind. 
oppose,You haven't mentioned anything about stopping vandals which in my opinion is the point of being an admin. You just haven't got your priorities in the correct order. 
support,who steals the nominators spot while the nominator is away notifying the nominated? 
support,all my encounters with him have been excellent but my main reason is he edited my user page. I admire that. Plus are met. Will make a great admin. [[user:Celestianpower|Cel]][[WP:ESP|e]]
support,[[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,I see him revert vandalism and do great work at [[George W. Bush]] all the time and he seems like a great contributor. 
support,Voldy is a trustworthy character ironically with plenty of good experience a good attitude and active in areas where admin tools would be useful. 
support,I really don't understand why JETFA is being held against him. [[User Talk:Acetic Acid|Ac]][[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]][[User Talk:Acetic Acid|tic]][[Special:Random|']]
support,Everyone else has said it all really.
support,[[WP:ESP|e]]
support,Just edit the freakin' article I say . I'm willing the candidate the benifit of the doubt when comes to the personal attack reform as most of them seem to be from over two months ago. 
support,I've seen nothing but good contributions and he is clearly committed to the goal of creating an encyclopaedia of the highest quality. (Further comments in the comments section). 
support,Great user useful in vfd 
support,Yes please. I'm happy to take the candidate's word that the personal attacks are over. 
support,[[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,those personal attacks aren't nice but they're several months ago and he has been a worthwhile user other than that incident. 
support,the oppose reasons are ridiculous. 
support,The personal attacks while regrettable are far enough in the past for me and having been involved in the Gabrielsimon incident(s) I have seen how that particular editor can bring out the worst in people including myself. I admire the Dark Lord's work on [[George W. Bush]] and AfD. I think he can be trusted with the mop. 
support,byegones be bygones. 
support,Strong even though he killed Harry Potter's parents 
support,The personal attacks are indeed worrying but it appears to me that Voldemort was learning to get to grips with how the community works and I trust him not to do it again (I'm assuming that there were no personal attacks after those quoted by fvw). I see no other reasons to oppose (JETFA echoes my own concerns). 
support,I'm familiar with Lord Voldemort as a helpful contributor at [[WP:FPC]] and have no objections. Comment: I was prompted to come and see this rfa after stumbling across what I considered to be an unfair request on a user talk page for an oppose vote here. Having read the lot as well as several more user talk pages I think the way LV has responded to all of this demonstrates commendable maturity and restraint ~ 
support,support: no reason to oppose. as far as I know adminship does not bring with it a "make personal attack or immature page button." 
support,Notable objections have been raised but what I have seen of this editor has left me with a favorable impression. I believe that Lord Voldemort can safely be entrusted with admin powers. 
support,the personal attacks don't add up to much and his contributions are undisputed. 
support,From his namespace span I can see that he's dedicated at both articlewriting and relationshipbuilding. Can see that he will become a good admin. 
support,I'm willing to trust LV. Everyone deserves a chance especially after an apollogy for previous mistakes has been offered. 
support,if he continues his personal attacks he can always be desysoped and Shauri's trust is a good reason.
support,Your choice of username does not inspire trust but as a kid I used to assemble plastic models of the Wolfman and if that's good enough for a [[Top Gun]] pilot's call sign ... anyway if you block someone wrongly the rest of us can always unblock them so: best wishes! 
support,also I think that there's anything wrong with your name. It's a character from [[Harry Potter]]!!! 
support,if you pay attention to the annoucement board you might see why me supporting his nomination might be significant (goes to make annoucement)
support,meets my standards. The personal attacks while worrying seem far enough in the past we don't have to worry. 
support,from neutral based on intelligent earnest good faith confrontation of issues against. Right "disposition" proved to my mind. 
support,if one is actively trying to look for poor editing behaviour one will most certainly find it. The opposite holds true too this user is willing to learn and mature and this makes all the difference. 
support,STRONG SUPPORT or that lesbian crap. lol. He claims to be evil!!! I like it! Just playing : ) 
oppose,JETFA is a perfect example of the immaturity that seems to be creeping into Wikipedia. I am increasingly seeing users make offensive comments when voting and editing in general. In addition to the "extreme" votes other users have been voting neutral just for the sake of voting with ridiculous comments ("Neutral until candidate answers the question" or "Neutral I have not interacted with this user"). I see JETFA as inextricably tied to this voting pattern. 
oppose,Strong Oppose I agree JETFA is an extremely immature sort of diversion. While has some strengths as an editor his weaknesses are such that I do not believe he is fit for adminship. Add to this his history of personal attacks and he is not a good candidate. 
oppose,Although he has done good work on [[George W. Bush]] and other articles this user has a history of personal attacks. 
oppose,<http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Lord_Voldemort&diff=15206302&oldid=15206287 making> <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Lord_Voldemort&diff=18599057&oldid=18468572 personal attacks> and then when someone removed those attacks <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Lord_Voldemort&diff=18600285&oldid=18599729 attacking> <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Lord_Voldemort&diff=18601305&oldid=18600285 that person> is not indicative of the right disposition for adminship. 
oppose,The personal attacks violate Wikipedia norms for [[Wikipedia: Civility|civility]] and are not indicative of a potential administratorat least not right now. 
oppose,Although admins are no more than regular contributors with a few extra buttons they are often seen as representatives of Wikipedia especially by new people. Because of this I cannot support someone who resorts to abuse rather than entering into a dialogue when he has a problem with a fellow Wikipedian. Also although I believe it was created with good intentions JETFA is in my opinion unhelpful. 
oppose,based on the above comments lack of time and low edit count. 
oppose,for the same reasons as Alkivar. 
oppose,Weak oppose the difs shown above and other discussion of personal attacks don't look good. I'd be willing to support in a few months. 
oppose,Weak oppose. There is some reason for concern so I sugges waiting a few more months just to make sure. 
oppose,let's just wait a bit on this one to see how things develop re. the propensity for personal attacks. 
oppose,as per above 
oppose,Administrators have to have a certain disposition. Regardless of whether he apologized for the personal attacks in question I expect an admin candidate to have never made them at all. May support in a few months but not now. 
oppose,Weeeak oppose I'm slightly concerned about some of the user's behavior. 
oppose,Oppose. 
oppose,Oppose pro temps. Don't recall having interacted with this user but this seemed close enough to merit peering at a few links. Am concerned enough by several of the issues raised to prefer to wait a while longer especially given the relatively short time here anyway. But seems willing (and able) to learn from his mistakes so I'd be inclined to support at said later occasion if that indeed continues to prove the case. 
oppose,<http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Lord_Voldemort&diff=18601305&oldid=18600285 No> This shows very poor judgement. It's easy to apologise for something after the fact but good judgement comes in not calling someone a Homo in the first place. I'm sorry but the apology should have come way before this nomination. You certainly have the forgivness you ask for but I think the extra buttons should wait a while longer. 
oppose,Calling someone a "homo" is not acceptable behavior. 
support,About damn time. 
support,All this sockpuppet stuff is baloney. Can you say filibuster? Whether Lst27 is Alex <removed> or not we're NOT dealing with a troll or a vandal. I also supported ABCD who is also said to be Alex <removed>. Lst27 hasn't done anything in his main namespace edits to make me dubious of his abilities. 
support,Good point. (
support,he has shown himself to be a good user. As for the Alex <removed> thing: if he hadn't admitted to being Alex he would have faced further months of hounding. 
support,I support this nomination. I know there have been allegations that got kicked around like a football but that's old hat now and I think it's neither fair nor helpful to recycle unproven accusations this far down the track. At any rate this is an Englishlanguage encyclopedia and "innocent until proven guilty" is a fundamental principle in every Englishspeaking country that I know of. This user is a good editor; to be sure he's had a few runins but I'd be hardput to name a user who hasn't. Give the guy a break for goodness sake. 
support,Given that the last > edit was 29 Jun 2004 I just don't see how the [[Wikipedia:Sock puppet|sock puppet]]ry accusations even if true are relevant to this RFA. 
support,after careful consideration. I give him the benefit of the doubt. If anything goes wrong we can always desysop. 
support,The issue of identity has been resolved to my satisfaction. 
support,The who is or isn't who should get resolved first before RFA . I noted that lot of edits lack summaries. 
oppose,This user first claimed in no uncertain terms not to be Alex <removed> <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ALst27&diff=5911050&oldid=5907962> then turned around and claimed that he was Alex <removed> <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ALst27&diff=6154395&oldid=6153369>. Thus he has made false statements about his identity on at least one occasion (it's not clear to me what he claims now or what the truth of the matter is). Also actions such as putting up a public listing of users he would not support for adminship <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ALst27&diff=9490705&oldid=9490385> suggest a lack of the maturity one would hope for in an admin. 
oppose,Sorry Alex <removed> has been trying to get an adminship under I can't remember how many different names now and whether Lst27 is or is not Alex <removed> he either lied when denying he was Alex <removed> or else he lied when he said he was Alex <removed>. Either way doesn't give me warm fuzzies. 
oppose,See comments. Will change to support if it turns out to be a misunderstanding. Oppose firmly. Alex's behavior as is highly suspicious: I can't see why it took him four months to ask Lst27 to stop claiming his identity nor can I see why he <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Lst27.09&diff=next&oldid=9205307 removed> all instances of the name "Alex <removed>" only from [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Lst27.09]] even though it's linked from [[Special:Whatlinkshere/User:Alex<removed>|numerous other places]] and still visible on . That is suspicious to say the least. Even if Lst27 isn't Alex (and I've been wrong about this [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/ABCD|once before]]) it is a bad sign that he maintained the claim on his userpage for six months and even <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/ABCD&diff=11376290&oldid=11376243 strongly implied> that he was Alex as recently as 22 March. (See comments below for explanation of this diff.) Either way I have to oppose. 
oppose,Oppose. Even if the preponderance of evidence is of a fine and harmless editor the admin corps is not important enough either that he needs to have that pin on his lapel or that we can't do without him. I don't care what all the wierdness and all the persistance about adminship means; adminship isn't important enough to justify wading through all that to a situation of confidence. 
support,He possesses copious free time and energy and my interactions with him in the past indicate he's not the kind of guy to go out on a limb and do something stupid with administrative priveleges. He is also quite afctive in the community especially on IRC (my stats report him as. 
oppose,Aren't you the same guy who was digging around for arbitration "violations" on me and eagerly reporting them? 
oppose,Needs more experience. 
oppose,not enough experience although I would support after a couple more months 
oppose,Although you do some good work I'm going to echo the votes above and say that you need some more experience before asking for adminship. 
oppose,Not enough experience. 
oppose,Sorry but no. Maybe in a few months. 
oppose,Should we create a rule to prohibit RfA requests for users with less than 1000 edits? 
oppose,Will support later. Lacks experience. Sorry. 
oppose,I've already told him that 500 would be too little for RFA before he submitted so I have to oppose. 
oppose,Too new. 
support,Me of course. 
support,See comments to Jobe's oppose. 
support,I asked him a question about deletionism on IRC. He replied "I've purposely avoided the inclusionist/deletionist thing; I don't like partisan politics." . 
support,Luigi has demonstrated intellegence and tact which are traits we really need from administrators. | [[User_talk:Linuxbeak|Talk]] | 
support,That's hot. 
support,Super Mario! Having over 10000 and not being an admin I dont believe in edit counts mattering. 
support,Excellent candidate. Committed to unglamorous work that is however essential. 
support,Sweet yams! [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,this candidate oppose editcountitis. 
support,Been around a bit clueful not insane 
support,Yes please as per David Gerard. 
oppose,1333 edits in a year thats not much activity lack of edit summaries and spends too much time on Chess. 
oppose,I agree with needs more edits (only 500 edits in article namespace). We need to know he is 'not an idiot' but we also need someone who is 'involved'. </sup/><p style="fontfamily: Bradley Hand ITC Comic Sans MS;">
oppose,Will support at 1K article edits. 
oppose,I'm pretty sure this guy insulted me at some point in the past. 
oppose,Weak oppose. Luigi30 doesn't seem to have enough experience to be an admin. 
oppose,There's nothing wrong with encouraging wouldbe admins to get a little more experience first. Please keep editing start using edit summaries consistently and in due course you will be a shooin. 
oppose,not enough experience. 
oppose,more time and will support 
support,He seems to have done some good contributions. Although this is his second nomination i still support him. 
support,meets my admin criteria on my userpage. More edit summaries would be nice but I do not consider that grounds to oppose. 
support,if the only objections anyone can come up with are edit count and edit summaries. 
support,No one has offered any evidence of bad behaviour. This editor seems willing to learn from his previous errors and seems eager and willing to contribute as an admin. Seems distinctly noncrazy. Give him the mop! 
support,per Hamster. 
support,[[Wikipedia:Esperanza|ε]]
oppose,Firstly the user neglected to tell us that this is his second nomination; the first can be found [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/maltesedog|here]]. Fortunately for him he misspelled the page on that first nom so he didn't have to use "Maltesedog 2" as the current nom page name (but it still took the help of another editor to <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship&curid=2609425&diff=30826102&oldid=30825838 set this one up>). Secondly while I'm not bothered by the fact that this user has under 900 edits (using his registered name) it does bother me that usage of edit summary is under 30%. This was brought up in the first nomination but didn't seem to make much of an impression on Maltesedog. 
oppose,Lack of edit summaries. 
oppose,Lack of edit summaries and < 1000 edits. 
oppose,per above. Please consider withdrawing this nom. and returning in six months or so. 
oppose,per above. 
oppose,lack of edit summaries recomend greater use of the preview button as well. 
oppose,edit summaries and low edit count. 
oppose,Edit summaries sleazy behavior.
oppose,per Interiot's tool here <http://faleg.org/cgibin/wannabe_kate?username=Maltesedog&site=en.wikipedia.org> is a total newbie with minimal contributions to regular articles spends a lot of time discussing policy and AFDs. The fact that they failed their first RFA so abysmally and then still came in for a 2nd one which they are failing badly shows guts but not wisdom. I think I do that many edits per day. So a big time newbie in my book. 
oppose,Only been here a bit over a month and only has 63 edits. Not nearly enough material to base the administrator trust decision on. Would need a really strong argument to overcome that. And the butchering of the RFA template isn't helping either. 
oppose,Very strong über oppose. Only has 63 edits messed up the RfA template accepted his own selfnom has no user page doesn't have the idea of Wikipedia yet and in general has to go through the learning curve yet. Way too early to become an administrator. 17:19 26 Jun 2005 (UTC) My previous concerns still stand but having seen quite a few IP edits (albeit without edit summaries) and some moves such as creating a user page i'll now just oppose due to lack of time as a user and lack of knowledge of Wikipedia (practically no involvement in the Wikipedia namespace VfD etc. aswell). 
oppose,Has not been around long enough to show if he is trustworthy or not.
oppose,I'm sorry but you're way too green. Come back show some good contributions stick around for roughly three months and reapply. | [[User_talk:Linuxbeak|Talk]] | 
oppose,A new user who should have familiarised himself with the usual standards we expect of candidates before nominating himself. If you wish to battle vandalism there's no need to be an admin to do so. Come back after a few months and several thousand edits. 
oppose,Much too soon. His edits are not only too few (and very narrowly focused) but tend to need cleaning up and his understanding of Wikipedia is weak (he made something of a mess of the selfnomination. In a few months maybe. 
oppose,While the user seems to be a good contributor much too new to Wikipedia. Still I encourage him to renominate himself in a few months. 
oppose,Sorry not enough edits yet. 
oppose,Sorry but the edit count is WAY low even if we count earlier anon edits (below). Would possibly support after more interaction and experience. 
oppose,Sorry even the anon edits (which shouldn't be counted since they could be anyone) don't add up to enough experience for you. You are a good faith editor so definitely come back when you have more edits under your belt and more experience in the Wikipedia: namespace. 
oppose,Sorry but too soon. What work I've seen is good but as Deathphœnix and others have said admin now would be too hasty. If you keep going as you are I've no doubt you will become an admin just not now. 
oppose,Oppose too new. 
oppose,Oppose way too new. I would suggest trying again in 34 months when your edit numbers are closer to 1 or 2000. I would suggest joining one of the major cleanup projects like wikification or the Cleanup Taskforce or possibly a WikiProject. 
oppose,way to new 
oppose,on the grounds of being too new but please continue to contribute to Wikipedia. One day you may make a fine admin. 
oppose,He's still a youngling (pretty much like me) 
oppose,Extremely few edits definitely unable to determine suitability. 
oppose,Oppose. Applying for admin status after only two months of contributions indicates anxiety. There is no such thing as an anxious admin. 
support,As nominator..... 
support,Excellent user. 
support,"Why do we need an admin who isn't going to help out with administrative chores? That's what admins do by and large." Yeah okay... 
oppose,Why do we need an admin who isn't going to help out with administrative chores? That's what admins do by and large. I also question whether an editor with only 306 mainspace edits (a sizable chunk of which appear to be just adding portals or creating redirects) has sufficient community experience to be an admin. No evidence of participating in RC patrol; only minor evidence of participating in VfD. Spend some time doing janitorial work come back in three months. 
oppose,Useful effective editor but lacks experience and shows no commitment to admin tasks. 
oppose,To be a admin one must accept all of the responsibilities and then take on all of the jobs as well. Will support when interest in administrative tasks is shown. 
oppose,This editor does not appear to understand the prime purpose of admins and as such cannot be promoted to such a level. 
oppose,Reluctantly oppose. Seems like he means well but 300 edits is a bit too few. Please come back a little later. 
oppose,Agree with the above. 
oppose,There's a reason why this is a selfnomination this user is obviously unknown in the Wikipedia community. Thus not appropraite to be named admin. 
oppose,Doesn't seem to want to do any of the real duties of an admin only to muck about with the HTML on one page 
oppose,Being an admin is more than just working on the main page. 
oppose,Sorry mate. Only 300 edits to the article space. I failed an adminship nomination because of that once (only 360 edits in total at time of nomination.) 
oppose,Inexperience and overeagerness are the sticking points for me.
oppose,User seems goodnatured but only has around 650 edits. Also the "articles i'm proud of" barely extended past being stubs. 
oppose,(for now). So far has insufficient edits to determine suitability. 
oppose,Too early. If you don't have at least 1000 edits you don't have much of a chance. 
oppose,Oppose. Only five months contributing. Wait another four months and I might support you. 
oppose,Not yet. 
oppose,You're a bit green still but you look like you've got good intentions. Pretty much everything that needs to be said has already been said. | [[User_talk:Linuxbeak|Talk]] | 
support,We now know what the candidate will look like. I feel that the candidate is well intentioned if not too active. Also creates a lot of stubs which is annoying but there does not appear to be anything that would cause one to vote against although lack of wikipedia namespace edits may cause concern to some. Also it seems that those who vote "not enough time" may very well do the same even six months from now due to low edit count. So it almost appears as if this is another case where a vote now may be an indefinate vote due to somewhat unchanged patterns. 
support,I trust his judgement and if he uses his powersw rarely it doesn't bother me. Why has noone seemed to vote? 
support,definitely well intentioned. seems like a good editor.
oppose,not enough time. Copyright violations also detract. 
oppose,Seems like a nice guy but needs more experience. 
oppose,You really need to be over about 3000 edits to have a shot here. You are still not even halfway there. 
oppose,Copyright problems [[Josh Quittner]] and [[Adam Horowitz]] for example. 
oppose,Copyright violation=bad. [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
oppose,due to low edit count copyright problems lack of experience et cetera. 
oppose,Less then 500 Mainspace edits almost all of which are minor edits (?). Looks like a little more use of the Preview button would be in order too. Lots of good image work though! 
oppose,Weak Oppose Good editor but you need to learn more about wikipedia. To start you didn't sign your selfnom or acceptance (<nowiki></nowiki>) and the answer to the first question makes me wonder if you know what adminship entails. You don't need to be an admin to edit articles we need admins to clear AfD backlogs block vandals do speedy deletions protect/unprotect pages and a whole host of other things. You are a good editor come back in a month or two with more understanding of wikipedia and I'll gladly support. 
oppose,The amount of edit summaries this user ever typed can be counted on one hand. 
oppose,User has never participated in the AfD process. &#126;
oppose,Sorry no. [[Image:Flag_of_Europe_and_Austria.svg|20px]] 
oppose,needs more experience.
support,I definitely support minghong as an admin 
support,I think minghong should learn from the concerns expressed by Adrian but he should be given the benefit of the doubt. 
support,Benefit of the doubt. I assume good faith. 
support,Talk page looks good contribs look good and I like how he handles himself in situations where so many others might get upset and start yelling. 
support,Talk page and contributions look ok. Doesn't look like he'll abuse admin power. 
support,He seems to be very active and has made contributions to a number of articles. Will make a good administrator. 
support,Would be a welcome and fresh addition to our current crop of administrators. 
support,Yes has shown himself to be a trustworthy and active community member understands policy plays well with others. 
support,Looks all right to me and he seems to respond to rational discourse. 
oppose,Oppose. 
oppose,I have nothing against him as an editor but his deletionism is too intense for me to be able honestly to support him for adminship. 
oppose,This answer below concerns me: It would be great if I can revert bad edits and delete improper contents. Any editor can revert bad edits but delete improper contents? That answer together with the comments of others here leads me to reluctantly oppose this time. 
oppose,like Jonathunder his answer to question #1 doesn't tell me that he knows what an admin does. 
oppose,I have to agree with Jonathunder. 
oppose,I've become even more convinced that Wikipedia requires community awareness and restrained boldness from experienced editors and even more so from administrators. Rash actions are mostly more harmful than inaction. 
support,been through the contributions and talk this user is hardly a threat. If he wants the tools he may have them. 
oppose,from his statement at the top and his answer to question 1 he seems to know little of what adminship entails and from his lack of edits to talk namespaces he seems to have interacted little with the community at large. [[user:Celestianpower|Cel]][[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
oppose,I rarely oppose and I think this is only the second or third time I've done so for a non trivial issue. I would like to know why you want to be an administrator? Is is to get the rollback function and block users while working on your favourite article who have conflicting interests? You've been here since 2003 and you have 1300+ edits and hardly anything in namespaces other than the main namespace. Please explain with a valid reason why you have a diparity in distribution wrt time. Since you contribute in the main namespace I have some questions: I've checked your upload log but I still need some answers how well do you know about image copyrights? Do you know the correct formats to use? It seems to me that you don't know anything about [[Fair use]] and copyrights. Can you prove me wrong? I also checked out the [[Mohegan Sun]] article. Do you know wikipedia's target audience? The article is slightly larger than a stub; why do like the article so much? Are you aware that driving directions are not considered encyclopedic? 
oppose,weak Oppose well his reaction to the first oppose makes me wonder if this user can handle disagreement: "I'm sorry I won't allow you to try to bring me down. 10:16 15 October 2005 (UTC)" ??? Besides adminship isn't needed to improve articles and correct misspellings. (
oppose,your edit count and distribution seems okay but your reasons for wanting adminship are misguided. You have done scant RC patrol you haven't been active in voting here at RfA at all. You have been active at IFD and AFD which is good. Your edit summary usage looks fairly high which is good. Stay active at IFD/AFD do more RC patrol vote more in community events such as RfA and next time give us a better reason of why you need the admin tools and I will have no problem supporting. 
oppose,per Drini...woops...got a little confused there... 
oppose,per Drini. 
oppose,per everyone aboveespecially his reaction to Celestianpower's vote. 
oppose,If that was the intent of Celestianpower's vote it appears to have worked. Also the answer to Q1 misunderstands the nature of adminship. It is not the role of admins to monitor Wikipedia's articles any more than other editors. They are not moderators they are janitors. 
oppose,per all those reasons given. 
oppose,Don't like the reasons he gave. 
oppose,Strong Oppose His response to Celestianpower showed to me that he's unable to deal with disputes in a constructive way his edit count is low the response to answer #1 shows a complete misunderstanding of admin duties(regarding asking for consensus before doing anything which almost sounds like someone would need to babysit him) and the final nail in the coffin was the self nom per my views on them at . 
oppose,I've seen Celestianpower here for quite some time and he neither baits nor bites. The above response seems to assume bad faith. 
oppose,Sorry to pile on but he's hung himself. 
oppose,agree with Celestianpower and Drini. User seems naive in the ways of Wikipedia. 
oppose,for reasons already stated by Drini and others 
oppose,Oh Dear God No! waaaaaay too green of a user to even ponder the chance of rollback and blocking powers responses to some of the above opposition votes makes me wonder if this person can take criticism at all without considering it a personal attack. 
oppose,which I don't think I've ever done as per the response to . Immediately going into a defensive stance and violating [[WP:AGF]] because of criticism is a disqualifier in my book. If you become an admin you'll be faced with vandals with much less scruples than an admin has. 
oppose,Sorry about piling on but I have to agree with Celestianpower and Drini. Needs more experience first and we'll see what happens. 
oppose,Response to Celestianpower is worrying. 
oppose,per Bjarki 04:28 19 October 2005 (UTC) after reviewing responses I have changed my mind
oppose,Weak Oppose I'm a little bothered by your userinteraction specifically the lack of it (see <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3AContributions&offset=0&limit=50&target=Monkbel&namespace=3> <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3AContributions&offset=0&limit=50&target=Monkbel&namespace=4> and of course <http://kohl.wikimedia.org/~kate/cgibin/count_edits?user=Monkbel&dbname=enwiki kate>). You seem like a really good user and with some more community contribution I will certainly support in the future (a few months or so). 
oppose,Only 19 wikipedia namespace and 19 user talk edits and less than 1000 overall u look like a good user but probaly in a few months I will support but not now 
oppose,[[Opera|Oppose]] Per reasons given above. 
oppose,Lucks good communication skills (as from my experience in Belarusian Wikipedia). Sometimes pushes POV. Makes policy decision without discussing with other contributors (Byelorussia/Belarus Belarusian łacinca articles names). Doesn’t understand image copyrights issues well enough. 
oppose,too inexperienced 
oppose,The vote thing. 
oppose,per above. 
oppose,Kate's tool counts <http://kohl.wikimedia.org/~kate/cgibin/count_edits?user=Mrmattkatt&dbname=enwiki five edits> in three destinct pages (1 article 2 user and 2 user talk edits) this might be because the first edit was made September 14 2005! Please come again in 34 months when you have atleast 1500 edits in atleast 10 different namespaces. </sup/><p style="fontfamily: Bradley Hand ITC Comic Sans MS;">
oppose,I was a bit confused by the 5 edits also. 
oppose,and this should be removed. The original nominator was an anom and now is a user with Zero edits. Also the nominee has 6 edits now and apparently has not been here for awhile at least not under this username. So the nomination is based on a lie. The intent is to scam. 
oppose,<http://kohl.wikimedia.org/~kate/cgibin/count_edits?hash=4e50e5c9f650e66b69dc10cdf9cbe861e19195c2&user=Mtmdem&dbname=enwiki 50 total edits> is simply not enough.
oppose,only be editing for 6 days on very few articles 
oppose,Too green with red talk page. 
oppose,not ready by any means. 
oppose,Needs to demonstrate the claimed depth of knowledge preparedness to deal with the gruntwork and ability to interact with other users. 
oppose,Mtmdem started out editing articles pretty much the same way I did and seems to have many of the same interests. If he sticks around I'm sure he will be a valuable asset to Wikipedia. However I have over 3 times as many edits as he does and would not even consider nominating myself at this point. Someone with 50+ total edits is not ready. 
oppose,some months too early. 
oppose,as above 
oppose,as per reasons above. Is this actually serious? 
oppose,Weak oppose This user really needs more experience on Wikipedia. However I've seen a good start. I would reccomend renominating yourself in a month or two months if you want to be an admin and really feel that you're ready now. 
oppose,I'm sure this guy will at some time make an excellent admin giving him the authority right now would be a bit like electing [[Carnell Williams]] to the [[NFL Hall of Fame]] today: its just way too soon. 
oppose,No user page less than 50 edits. 
oppose,Nominator has only ten edits. This nomination doesn't make much sense. 
oppose,Pfffffffffft. See comments below. 
oppose,Agree with above. 
oppose,This nomination is hot...like Antarctica. 
oppose,Agree with above. 
oppose,nomination is presumably a joke but I'll vote oppose anyway... edit summaries including "Why dont you get some brains and write your own article dumbass????" (see <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Ainu_people&diff=prev&oldid=18970092 this edit> prove this user is not mature enough for adminship (despite being "elderly" according to the nominator). 
oppose,I am sorry but this candidate has not filled in the questions below and so I am unable to determine what the candidate intends to do with administrative privileges or indeed whether he is a suitable individual to receive them. Edit summaries do not demonstrate a knowledge of common civility and I cannot see any evidence of substantial contribution from him. 
oppose,No user page. 
oppose,Not nearly enough edits has insulting edit summaries and he doesn't have his own userpage! This nomination was probably a joke. 
support,Cabalerm...GO FOR IT!!Amen...[[User:Tdxiang|
support,Definitely. [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,I support him fully. 
support,I definitely would support this decision. 
support,I believe NickBush24 has the potential to become an excellent administrator! 
support,Heh. If your userpage gets vandalised 50 times you're doing something right. 
support,[[Soup|]]
support,the response to the antics of seals it for me. 
support,My support too. 
support,I beleieve NickBush24 would make a good admin. 
support,a bold fighter of vandals. 
support,[[WP:ESP|e]]
support,Vote change to Weakest Possible in Wikipedia History A good RC patroler but Im very worried about incivilty. In December maybe 
support,most certainly.
support,Yes definitely. A great RC patroller.[[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,[[Soup|]] He isn't already? 
support,Good vandal hunter. 
support,Definitely seen him liked him protected his pages. [[User talk:RoyBoy|Boy]] 
support,Continue to support. Nick has been here for quite a while and his first task was to begin RC patrol on a full time basis. If civility is a concern I volunteer to be an informal mentor to Nick to help diminish this problem. 
support,I've seen his edits and he also reverted vandalism on my own user page. 
support,Strong was helpful at GF still helpful now. 
support,this guy needs the tools! 
support,No wonder your name sounds familiar.. I've seen you all over the GameFAQs boards. :p 
support,(
support,Extreme [[Wikipedia:Revert|Mop]] and [[Wikipedia:Blocking policy|Flamethrower]] ! Vandals are dreading the day Nick gets those two tools. 
support,Go get the vandals! 
support,We are power incarnate! 
support,Excellent contributor. 
support,Good edits .
support,Unfair to accuse him of incivility. The vandal personally attacked him and said that he "hated" him. The response was perhaps a bit immature but not really so bad. 
support,Being rude to a newbie who'd made a test would be unacceptable. Being rude to a persistent vandal when you're getting the hassle this guy has is considerably less serious and imo is outweighed by all the excellent work he's done. I trust him not to abuse his admin powers and find it hard to imagine someone more deserving of the rollback button. 
support,Everyone has their limits and I've definitely seen worse reactions to persistent vandals. 
support,because of the odd opposition votes below. 
support,Some conflict is inevitable. Excellent editor. 
support,The diffs presented in the oppose column are regrettable and it would be better if those edits had been made differently. But they are certainly not the worst reactions to vandalism which I have seen here it does not seem to show a long pattern of incivility and they are not severe enough to push me into the oppose column. Indeed the history of vandalfighting and other good work puts me here among the supporters. 
oppose,I know this RfA will pass even with this oppose vote. I'm making it because of a <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3A129.15.120.186&diff=24711656&oldid=24711607 diff that I find clearly unacceptable> for an admin to make. I don't really care what the provocation is how immature a user is or what the situation is mocking a user is never an appropriate reaction for an admin to take. This is completely unacceptable. Nick you'll pass this RfA as it is 361 currently. But please promise you'll never engage in activity like that again. 
oppose,Durin is right it wasnt acceptable and this was only what..about a week ago. 
oppose,I would really really like to support but I have to agree with Durin's comments. I cannot support a user who <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:129.15.127.254&diff=24784520&oldid=24784387 taunts vandals> and seems to have a <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Reisio&diff=prev&oldid=22063202 short> <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:NickBush24&diff=21692689&oldid=21673780 temper>. 
oppose,per Durin. Temperament is a consideration of utmost importance for admins. 
oppose,per Jaxl. Too many incidents of incivility. 
oppose,this time round. Thanks to for above note I'd checked for incivility but missed any (which probably means it was just an offday; we all have them). 
oppose,as per Durins (and others) comments above. Vandalism and such can be frustrating but I would expect a much higher standard of any admin. If this were a year ago I'd give the benefit of the doubt but it was this month! 
oppose,Weak Oppose. I am so torn. He's a good vandal fighter but overall attitude seems harsh and unwelcoming. I believe this RfA will pass but please be aware of your tone in the future. You note in question 3 that you have never been in conflicts over editing but that seems to be what a lot of this RfA is about. [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
oppose,Weak oppose (changed from "support" after reading above) your abrasive attitude is probably at least half the reason you are vandalized :/ Seeing your excellent cleanup work I want to give you a mop but please using for scrubbing not hitting. 
oppose,a noticible fraction of edit summaries in your history are a bit over the top for me and I feel needs to be toned down before the mop is given. 
oppose,I just can't feel comfortable adminning someone with this history of incivility especially given his stated lack of experience in and techniques for dealing with conflict with other users. With all due respect to Essjay's offer of mentorship I'd rather see a change in his conduct before making him an admin. 
oppose,too many people have pointed out stuff that makes me uncomfortable with this nominee... perhaps later. 
oppose,While I feel NickBush24 has done some good work I expect all admins to be civil and not insult other [[Wikipedia:Wikipedians|Wikipedian]]s. Thanks! | [[User talk:Flcelloguy|A note? ]]</font color>| 
oppose,Very reluctant oppose mmm... tricky one. Definitely be a vandal's worst nightmare if he got the tools but not too sure about his temperement. That's what's difficult about tempremental vandalfighters Giving admin tools may bring both great good and great harm to Wikipedia. I'd like to see more WPspace edits in an admin though and I guess this pushes my vote toward oppose. 
oppose,per reasons given above 
oppose,Weakest conceivable oppose. I fully adhere to 's and 's comments above. Incivility is not a matter to be taken lightly and stirring the fire when dealing with vandals is the best way to ensure that they'll keep on hitting you and us all. I'm sure you'll make a great admin but not just yet a little more time and more control over your reactions and I'll gladly support you. 
oppose,Oppose for now incivility towards another user in recent edit history. Also I've been an admin since March 2004 and my user page hasn't been vandalised anywhere near as much as this user's which may also be a telling sign. 
oppose,familiarise yourself with [[WP:BITE]] and retry. Great apart from that. 
oppose,I wanted to support this but the evidence of incivility was too much. Keep your record clean then try again later. 
oppose,reluctantly as per the incidents recently brought to light surrounding issues of incivility. Please do not let the vandals get the best of you. Will gladly support in the future if these actions are not repeated. 
oppose,for now. I'd very much like to support him but the civility problem and the lack of communication (as per Lord Voldy) is making me leery. On the other hand the outburst certainly wasn't unprovoked: please refer to <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:NickBush24&diff=prev&oldid=24710638 this diff> to understand NickBush24's reaction. All of us have their bad days. All the same I'd feel better about this if this wasn't such a recent event. I am hoping that NickBush24 will consider the impact of his uncivil reaction on this discussion and reform. I would like to see him reapply in a month; if he can continue his good work with no similar occurences he'd definitely get my support then. 
oppose,Oppose for now despite excellent work on the whole. My problem is much the same as those above although I can definitely understand the reactions. I would advise NickBush24 to read about<http://www.usemod.com/cgibin/mb.pl?SoftSecurity Soft Security> which is the preferable way to deal with vandalism.
oppose,User has demonstrated a great deal of difficulty in following instructions. 
oppose,No excuse for selfnoms not answering the questions. Other than that relatively no edits and no major contributions. The fact that you need to cite adminship at a message board screams "Come back in six months." 
oppose,To cut it short: user has yet to answer the candidate questions has only very few edits outside of the <code>Article</code> and <code>User_talk</code> namespaces and does not sufficiently use the edit summary box. 
oppose,People above me said it best. 
oppose,User has a commendable dedication to the project but needs more experience. 
oppose,Maybe later. As it says at the top of the page Most new admins have at least three months of participation and 1000 edits. 209 is way too few. And none of those edits are to Wikipediaspace pages so there's very little interaction with the community so far (vital for an admin). Continue the good work and you'll probably end up an admin. But not just yet. As to what to do to become a more likely candidate get involved! Join a WikiProject. Add your voice to the votes on vfd cfd tfd sfd. Try to help out newbies on the Village Pump. The moreyou interact with the community the more likely we'll all be able to tell how good an admin you'd be. 
oppose,sorry. User is too new (if well intentioned) and failure to follow the proper procedures just adds weight to this. 
oppose,4 months is lots of time. 209 edits on the other hand don't showcase your talents enough. Also not answering the candidate questions shows a lack of understanding of Wikipedia. 
oppose,Please take your time to answer the candidacy questions first. It is an important criteria before anyone considers any support for you. 
oppose,for reasons already noted. 
oppose,I am normally against using edits or time for use as a qualifier in RFA's but I think that 4 months ans 209 are a little low I would also be interested in seeing you answer the questions so that we know what you like editing and what you are planning on using the extra tools for. 
oppose,not enough edits. Try again after about 1000 edits total and a couple hundred in the WP: namespace. 
oppose,Weak oppose. I generally don't look at edit counts at all when deciding on an admin vote so much as frequency and quality. The nom performs well in both senses but there's simply not enough for me to judge what his general attitudes/philosophies are and without the candidacy question answers I really can't say I know enough about the nom to be able to support him in clear conscience. Will consider changing my vote if answers are provided for said questions (no promises though). 
support,does good work. Would be an asset.
support,Lack of interaction just shows effective noncontroversial work. I'm not convinced the people with full talk pages are the best Wikipedians. 
support,doesn't seem likely to abuse admin tools. 
support,Opposers are too circumspect on this one. 
support,In agreement with the User Smit. Talk pages of most people are like the same 3 or 4 talking to each other like chat. Not much work done just chatting with the buddies. The candidate has a good work record.
oppose,1000 edits in 6 months is not much. Not enough involvement in maintainance and deletionrelated procedures (more specifically not enough involvement to convince me that this user is sufficiently familiar with Wiki procedures). And I would have liked to see more thought put into the guide questions especially considering this is a selfnomination. 
oppose,reluctantly. Editor sounds quite nice and article content is paramount but some substantial experience with project space is needed. "Better safe than sorry vote" until editor has a record in that area. 
oppose,Extremely weak oppose. 1000 edits and 6 months on Wikipedia is all fine but what I find strange is the low activity of the talk page. When I was sysopped I also had been here for 6 months and already had close to 40 topics on my talk page. This is a sign of lack of interaction with other Wikipedians. If the candidate replies to this I might change my vote. 
oppose,per JIP.
oppose,Seems like a nice guy but with no community interaction it is difficult to assess the candidate's communication skills. His answers to the questions below make me think Niz would have some trouble dealing with daytoday admin tasks. Perhaps try again in a few months? 
oppose,for now. Seems like a nice fellow but concerned about newness combined with lack of community interaction. Needs a little more time and activity on Talk: pages. 
oppose,no community interaction only 1000 edits in 6 months etc. I just don't believe Niz to be ready sorry. 
oppose,While I generally hold admins to a high standard I hold selfnominating ones to an even higher one. Your short answers to the questions are therefore not good. In particular some examples for question #3 would have been nice plus a little more than "etc" for question number one. 
support,Much respect to helpers of WikiProject Missing Articles. 
support,Fits . [[user:Celestianpower|Cel]]
support,Fine user. 
support,Tons of edits for someone who has only been here three months. 
support,Even closes VfDs and not even an admin yet! Like some kind of strange preminition.... 
support,Seems to me like a good user. 
support,Not bad at all. I myself started off as an anonymous editor for months on end and then I got crazy enough to register a username. Before I reached my 3rd month mark I was nominated and elected for adminship. I don't see why you shouldn't be any different given the fact that you're an active editor and vandalfighter. | [[User_talk:Linuxbeak|Talk]] | 
oppose,hasn't been here long enough. 
oppose,per Astrotrain. 
oppose,lack of experience barring answer to question below. 
oppose,Strong Oppose The user has not specified an email ID as of this post. If he blocks someone how is that person going to contact him? 
oppose,An Administrator must not be deterred by vandals no matter how many. 
support,I've had very good experiences in working with him (we both edited in articles relating to actress [[Hunter Tylo]] who is a bornagain Christian). I support gladly. 
support,I do not believe in a selfnomination and a sponsorednomination they are both the same. I have not seen this user do anything bad and trust that he or she will use admin powers to good use. 
support,I note from experience the difficulty in being a Christian Wikipedian and would characterize many of the religion articles as thirdrail issues that frequently lead those who touch them to burn out on conflict. In contrast "Salient"'s efforts have been factual and evenhanded. 
support,I found One Salient Oversight useful both in terms of information about Christianity and how things work at wikipedia when I was encountering problems with a Christian who I felt was putting very strong biases into [[Javier Solana]]; he was supporting me the self confessed nonChristian who actually didn't want any subtle religious elements coming into what should be a straightforward political article. I haven't read any of his edits; I would imagine he could make a quite contentious admin but that is not necessarily a bad thing. 
oppose,Oppose. Heavy POV is unsuitable for adminship. 
oppose,As far as I can see does not meet my 
oppose,No summaries given for edits. 
oppose,for now no edit summaries subtle religious POV unconvinced on whether he really changes his mind as claimed. 
support,for reasons listed in nomination. 
support,Yes tireless with fighting vandals in addition to making excellent contributions will be a valuable admin. (and I guess I'm jumping the gun before he even accepts) 
support,Strongest possible support. I'm jumping the gun as well. Pavel tags and bags more copyvios and vandals than the freaking FBI. I would love to be there when he blocks the particularly egregious ones. 
support,I see Pavel patrolling constantly and he does great work. He will need to acknowledge that admins must follow due process in warning vandals several times before blocking and must block for short periods (up to 24 hours) for first offences. I say this because he often asks for vandals to be blocked permanently and that is not usually appropriate.
support,his handling of vandalims is superb 
support,Nuclear wessels for everyb oh wait wrong guy. :/ 
support,Benefit of the doubt. Assume good faith. 
support,One of Wikipedia's best bouncers at restraining vandals. 
support,the policemen!
support,Opposition appears to be coming from POVpushers several of whom I've run across myself. 
support,has done excellent work versus vandals and POVwarriors. 
support,has done some good work. 
support,good editor will make fine admin 
support,based on above and below.
oppose,Vozenilek casts his net way too wide for what he calls vandalism. While he does cite real vandals he also accuses people of vandalism if they do not say agree on his assessment of Czech politics. Vozenilek already is abusing his authority as a user I can imagine how it would be if he was an admin. 
oppose,Of course Pavel should be thanked for patrolling but his views on blocking are unacceptable. I strongly believe that we should not surrender our tolerance and warmth out of fear of vandalism. I'd definitely want to see more sign that Pavel can control the itch in his trigger finger. 
oppose,Accused me of vandalism (actually listed me on VIP) because I removed a "pseudoprotected" template in an article where it was obviously misplaced as no one had voluntarily ceased editing. 
oppose,Concur with NoPuzzleStranger. 
oppose,I've been watching Paul engage in a number of edit wars (e.g. <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Le_Duc_Tho&action=history> <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Chandramukhi&action=history>) over the past few weeks. Both sides seem to be POVwarrioring and both sides have come close to (but not as far as I can tell violated) 3RR and Paul has been characterizing as "vandalism" edits he merely disagrees with. I am concerned that Paul would misuse administrative authority to win these edit wars. I am also bothered by the fact that he will make the second revert without first attempting to communicate with the other editor via either article or user talk pages; clearly his communication skills are not up to administrative standards. 
oppose,I don't like his views. He is not tolerant on Wikipedia. 
oppose,I have never encountered this editor but I don't like the complaints I read here. He's apparently one to paint vandalism with a broad brush and his comment of "I may help to stop vandals earlier as admin." does not sit well with me at all. To me that means he's willing to take action against vandals and I don't like his definition of vandalism so I can't support the action to put him in a position to exercise an incorrect definition of vandalism. 
oppose,As a user that has used Wikipedia for some time without being registered and now finally registering to add my articles additions to the site. I feel that it is beyond important to have unbiased admin. And as his history has shown he has very strong personal biases. That he expresses in edit wars. 
oppose,Not much direct experience of this user but extremely concerned about the apparent overreadiness to label edits as vandalism. (Of course by no means unique in this respect.) I think vandalism's clearly an issue on WP but that argues for scrupulous adherence to an agreed definition not for using the term overliberally esp. in the context of edit wars. Would be glad to support on a future occasion if such issues are resolved. 
oppose,It didn't take much to convince me of Pavel's exceedingly quick vandalaccusation trigger: just his most recent posting at [[Wikipedia:Vandalism_in_progress#213.42.2.22|WP:VIP]]. His only comment to the editor is accusation of vandalism after the editor made changes such as <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Devanagari&diff=prev&oldid=13027313 this> which for all I know might well be correct. Unless there is some other information I don't know of this is clearly not [[WP:AGF|assuming good faith.]] 
oppose,Way too fast on accusations of vandalism; "asking for a block" after [[User_talk:198.236.13.33|an IP]] hasn't received a single message in two months [[WP:VIP#211.31.77.168|Reporting]] a new anon making a mixed bag of <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&target=211.31.77.168 good and misguided edits> for vandalism etc. Enthusiasm and dedication to the project is fantastic but I can't see entrusting blocking power just yet; I'm very sorry. 
oppose,for now. Nothing personal but from my limited observations of this user he appears to lean a bit too heavily towards the [[m:deletionism|deletionist]] position. I'll change my vote next time if I'm proved wrong. 
oppose,Needs a few more months to mellow. 
oppose,agree with Charles. 
support,Strongly support. Pedant is a solid reliable trustworthy user. 
support,Raul's support is enough for me. 
support,I can't say I'm happy with the Abu Ghraib article situation but Pedant calls that the exception not the rule below and we should within reason be flexible to different approaches in exceptional circumstances. Even looking at the situation very pessimistically a mistake or even a handful of mistakes is not enough for me to oppose. 
support,Netoholic's opposition is enough for me. now come on! that's not a real reason to oppose! 
support,Don't drag editing disputes into RFA. I don't like the fork myself but the important point is that Pedant is able to build consensus not that everybody agrees with all he says. 
support,Xtra's point is enough for me.
support,Looks good. 
support,Fully agree with dab 
oppose,Sorry no.
oppose,Not reading the instructions on RfA and forking articles are both worrying behaviors. 
oppose,Neutrality's support is enough for me. 
oppose,No not at this time. 
oppose,Not yet convinced 
oppose,I strongly disagree with your statement below that "There are extremely rare times when a stated policy needs to get bent in order to fulfill the needs of the community." If you haven't yet found ways to find solutions to common problems within current policies or gone through the proper steps to change these policies permanently then I think you might need some more time getting used to Wikipedia. 
support,I don't see why it's a necessarily a virtue to involve oneself on others' talk pages. We're building an encyclopaedia not a chatroom. I urge the others to change their votes. Admin=no big deal remember? 
support,If Peter had asked me I'd have proposed him without hesitation. He's a selfconfessed [[Wikipedia:Wikipediholic|wikipediholic]] and has a track record of respecting both the rules and his fellow wikipedians. In addition he brings to the job professional skills as a journalist and a record of being an effective mediator in other Internet arenas. His edits include starting and polishing articles in a wide range of fields starting many new articles and showing himself prepared and competent to do painstaking and uncomplaining repairs to less skilled work by others. He's caused little if any controversy a born collaborator if ever there was one. I met him facetoface for the first time last weekend when I visited [[Canberra]] where he lives; Wikipedia and an unrelated email list to which we both contribute were the main reasons we arranged the meeting. An ideal candidate. 
support,With some reluctance. 
support,He can definitely be trusted with adminpowers. 
support,Give him a chance. We can always desysop if something goes wrong. 
support,Of course. 
support,Has established himself as a trustworthy contributor also Wikipedia is not a chatroom and I like users with high substansive contributions/talk ratio. 
oppose,Peter is a good editor but possibly hasn't interacted enough with other editors. Out of 1408 edits in over a year 64 appear to have been to article talk pages and 14 to user talk pages other than his own. (Correct me if I've got the figures wrong here Peter.) I'll definitely support in a couple of months if Peter can demonstrate a bit more interaction with others. 
oppose,Like Slim I'll support in the future if Peter gets more involved with the community. 
oppose,We're not building a chatroom true but the lack of interaction with others makes it hard to see how he'd handle admin responsibilities. 
oppose,Hasn't participated in the Wikipedia namespace enough. Is a good editor but without interaction with others it is hard to tell whether he would be good admin. 
oppose,Interacting with others is a major part of being an admin. Therefore the lack of interaction makes it difficult to see how he can handle it. 
oppose,Close but needs more community involvement. Get involved and there should be no problem supporting next time. 
oppose,What Grutness said. My extra points for the selfnom can't quite outweigh lack of community involvement and I'm thinking especially of Peter citing "I've NOT got caught up when I could have with several quite vociferous editors" as his best involvement in dispute resolution. 
oppose,with no personal offense to Peter I current oppose this nomination. i'd like to see many more edits so I can get a better understanding of his personality and style. 
oppose,More experience is needed. Less than 100 edits right now. Please keep up the good work try to use edit summaries more often and reapply in a few months. 
oppose,Premature ... RfA ... I do not believe in edit counts however I need proof of admin worthyness... 
oppose,seems to have too little experience. Talk page only consists of a welcome message user has less than 100 contributions (according to contributions list) and doesn't use edit summaries. 
oppose,Sorry I think you need much more experience. 
oppose,too little edits too soon etc. Sorry there is no reason to support you what so ever. 
oppose,A total of 3 edit summaries so far. Can we close this before it becomes a pileon? 
oppose,everything that needs to be said has already been said. 
support,See comment below. 
support,I support: although the line between bot and script is a fine one going over contributions does not reveal anything too worrying and convinces me in favour of granting sysop access now. 
support,I find the explanations given above and below sufficent. A script if used correctly cannot be used to deter adminship. Peter's done some good janitorial work. It doesn't matter how it's not as long as it's done.
support,though I'm taking a punt on this. That script seems OK but I think it would be wise for Peter to listen to others and make another account and run it from there even though his discretion is probably OK. He seems like an OK contributor. 
support,Would suggest that the bot be run under a different account but failure to do so is no reason to oppose adminship. 
oppose,Oppose. Mostly for running a bot on his main account. Also seems to have made some very poor deletion choices (speedy tags and votes). His seems to include functions which can be activated if the user has sysop rights to do certain activity ("function deletepage"). I consider bothandled sysop actions extremely dangerous. 
oppose,Poccil still needs more time IMHO to get in tune with the way the community works here. i would reconsider this at a later date depending on the track record. 
oppose,The bot script doesn't seem to understand the deletion policy.
oppose,Not really sure what the difference is between a script and a bot from a program standpoint. Regardless I do not want an automated deletion script to exist on an administrator account and will only support when I am sure this won't happen. 
oppose,I do not think scripts/bots should be run from any account and definatley not an admin account... 
oppose,Simply not good enough. 
support,Good contributor with what looks like a solid record and wants adminship for constructive reasons. 
support,Sure. 
support,Looks good to me. Maybe a little early but a solid record. 
support,Fine by me. Given the continuously rising standards for an admin I don't think this RFA will pass. However I believe a second nomination in a few months time would likely be successful. 
support,Strong 1200+ edits isn't all that early in my opinion and he appears to be a quality editor. I'd like to see him become an admin. 
oppose,....but only because I feel it is too early. I'd like to see more activity more experience with the peer groups more examples of acting well under pressure. I will probably support at a later date. 
oppose,at this time Poiuytman seems to be a very good editor but it takes more then editing skills to be a good administrator. As [[Wikipedia:Administrators' reading list]] says "Sysops must have an intimate understanding of Wikipedia policy". Also interpersonal skills are very important if not MORE important then knowing how to edit. As an administrator people are going to come to you with problems whether you want to deal with them or not; you have to be ready to deal with angry people from time to time. If all you want to do is edit then being an administrator will most likely be a distraction from what you really want to do. Poiuytman you do seem like a level headed person who could become a good administrator someday.... So I think that you if still want the hassles and responsibility of adminship after reading this then you most likely will become one eventually. 
oppose,Administrators should not merely be 'good' or 'acceptable'; they should be 'great'. Poiuytman seems too narrowly focused for my liking and I've seen little negotiating or moderating experience like a good adminstrator candidate should have. Wait a few months Poiuytman. 
oppose,Poiuytman based on what you answered on question #1 below here is what I suggest you can do to gain more experience: participate on the VFD discussions do RC patrol more to help spot vandalism and contribute to the discussions listed on [[WP:RM]]. You might also want to help out with the discussions on [[WP:CFD]] [[WP:TFD]] and help out on the articles listed on [[WP:DA]]. 
support,[[WP:ESP|e]]
support,Tags speedies reverts vandals welcomes users. 
support,Edits wellplaced across namespaces. Friendly and thoughtful whenever I've noticed a comment. 
support,Full 
support,seen him lots + experience always good = support [[user:Celestianpower|Cel]][[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,He's seriously involved in the project his intentions are good and he has what it takes to be a great admin. He's perfectly suited to wield the mop. 
support,I trust Shauri's judgment.
support,Weak Mistagging speedys are a concern but I think you deserve the rollback button and become a admin. 
support,& wouldn't be behind him if he didn't have what it takes. 
support,Strong This editor has tried very hard to make [[Wikipedia]] a better place and had he not nominated himself I or another person would have nominated him. The only two "negatives" I would hypothesize are (1) That he may spend too much time on a volunteer project to the detriment of "real life" responsibilities and (2) He is human subject to human error but otherwise he is a good neighbor seems to meet and exceed the requirements for Admin and thus gets my vote.
oppose,I like you as a user but there is a big reason why I feel I can't. You used to have the username something which I feel is wildly inappropriate. You're suggestion for a new username (when you decided to change it (the discussion can be found at [[Wikipedia:Changing username/Archive3]] near the bottom) was The Wandering Bastard something which I also find wildly inappropriate. I'm sorry but that is enough for me to oppose your rfa. 
oppose,I do seem to find myself in frequent disagreement with some of your philosophies and I'm sorry to say that leads me to oppose. Best wishes 
oppose,I've seen you around (but mostly on RFA) and think that more time is needed to gain familiarity with WP. 
oppose,Weak oppose for the moment. It is PB's bad luck that the first of his edits I have noticed was adding &#123;{db|movie review}} to [[Invisible Child]]. Since when was movie review a criterion for speedy? 
oppose,Weak Oppose I don't know exactly why but I have a bad feeling about this RfA. I don't like the message placed on . Also a good number of articles he speedied are still in existance (suggesting poor judgement). 
oppose,I don't think you have been around long enough. Your constant edit counting bothers me (sample comment: "1950 edits ha ha!") as does the selfnomination. The first article I clicked on that you edited was [[Rita Wilson]] which while small was wrong. The [[Carl Radle]] article is nice but there seems to be little else of substance except for lots of user page editing. You also state below (question 3) that you have "high standards for Admins" but selfnominate yourself after exactly 3 months? 
oppose,This editor appears from his userpage to have left Wikipedia in the last few hours apparently as a consequence of some criticism received here. Criticism is part of the deal whether an editor or an admin and having mistakes pointed out when they are made is a fact of life. If Private Butcher returns after a few months of balanced editing I imagine an RfA would be much easier. (PS: It's helpful to mention an old username. I didn't see Private Butcher around till very recently but I would have recognised Fascists Chicken at once.) 
oppose,I'm not sure if this user is mentally stable enough for adminship. Not so long ago he had a quite disturbing message on his user page about his RL happenings and this makes me think he wouldn't be able to bear the stress that the adminship gives. 
oppose,Obviously you don't meet the requirements for adminship (edits Wikispace experience general knowhow good faith etc.) but don't stop trying. I'm sure a few months of editing will be greatly beneficial and stand you in good stead for a run at adminship. Just to help us voters could you please link to you page of contributions under an IP address. Thanks. 
oppose,Simply not enough information about this editor to make an informed decision. Also doesn't help that he hasn't answered the Standard Questions. 
oppose,Nowhere near enough edits or Wikipedia experience and being an editor of a high school newspaper shouldn't be criteria for becoming an admin. Get more experience come back in a few months and I may consider supporting. 
oppose,Definitely oppose. With only one day of loggedin contributions this user has effectively no experience on Wikipedia at this time so (s)he does not qualify for adminship at all. I suggest that (s)he try again in nine months. 
oppose,I applaud the enthusiasm but as it says at the top of this page three months and 1000 edits is the usual bare minimum. Also editing articles is fine but admins do far more than that so it's worth getting involved in and finding out about some of the other facets of wikipedia before trying for admin status. If your enthusiasm is anything to go by I'm sure you'll eventually get to admin status but now is far too soon. 
oppose,6 edits?? I'd recommend waiting a few months (and about 1000 edits) and withdrawing the nomination. 
oppose,Oppose. I was only the copy editor. :( 
support,Just look at her sterling record folks
oppose,<http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Harry_Potter_and_the_HalfBlood_Prince&diff=prev&oldid=18936263 No.> 
oppose,Sorry 466 edits <http://kohl.wikimedia.org/~kate/cgibin/count_edits?user=Purplefeltangel&dbname=enwiki> is no where near enuf. Highly recommend the nominator withdraw the nomination as it's sure to fail and only can serve as a distraction to the nominee (and anyone else visiting this page). Note: Nominator only has 19 edits<http://kohl.wikimedia.org/~kate/cgibin/count_edits?user=Rainbowwarrior1977&dbname=enwiki>way too soon to be nominating users here (also doesn't even know where to leave messages<http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Purplefeltangel&diff=prev&oldid=19209618>)(also seems to have trouble determining gender"gentleman" v. "her"). 
oppose,As per Cryptic I have to oppose this nomination. 
oppose,Our edit counter stops at 466 and considering that one of the edits is vandalism there is no way that I can support this. 
oppose,edit count is much too small. 
oppose,Cannot trust him now because he has only 466 edits. I'll vote for you if you edit more and become more familiar with wikipedia
oppose,Weak oppose I'm sorry but I see quite a few questionableatbest edits in the contribution history which lead me to strongly suspect that the user has a very poor knowledge of policy (I would consider letting the edit that pointing out slide if it were the only questionable edit but it seems to only be the worst example.) Not so much the edit count though. If renominated later I will consider supporting. 
oppose,vandalism is never funny. Especially not when you do it right before an RfA. There's also <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:856b6ab0.jpg this> helpful contribution and <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Parallel_world&diff=prev&oldid=18434880 this> hidden away in an HTML comment which I have just reverted. I wonder about the seriousness of this nomination to be honest given the nominator's 48 hour exisntence and the nominees behvaiour. 
oppose,Strong Oppose I am the nominee and I have never met this person before. I have no idea who he is and why he's referring to me as a "gentleman." I think this was not a goodfaith nomination. And is absolutely right; I have vandalized a page so why should I be an admin? 
support,As nominator 
support,[[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,considered nominating her myself actually! 
support,yupsiree. 
support,recognizes her mistakes and has corrected her demeanor and actions. Great editor and easy to get along with. [[Special:Contributions/Who|&laquo;&raquo;]]
support,I saw some potential during the last RFA but then the vandalisms and such were too recent. Now it's been longer and the user seems to have learned. 
support,I was thinking of nominating her as well a few days ago but she wanted to wait a little bit. Apparently the demand was too great considering that a few people have wanted to nominate. She is the epitome of [[Wikipedia:WikiLove|Wikilove]] from my dealings with her if anything she's too nice and will need to thicken her skin a bit but i'd much rather have an admin who needs to be a little less nice than a alot more nice. This is a perfect opportunity for anyone who claims editcountitis to be a problem to rectify that situation. Her experience far exceeds her edits in my opinion but if that doesn't count I think I'd have to go harder onto the 2000 edit minimum. Comment on the vandalism and previous RFA situation below. 
support,Weak She is a bit young and the 2 month old vandalism did happen but she probably is ready. But please make sure you always use edit summaries for nonminor articles changes. Some people even demand 100% edit summary use although that is often unecessary.
support,This user shows all the signs of having learned from her actions come now worse vandals than her have been forgiven. Mike Garcia anyone? As far as I can see her actions lately have been civil constructive and definitely worthy of administrative powers. 
support,more and more I'm seeing people on RfA who I've interacted with/seen about the place doing good work and 2 months is definately in my opinion long enough in the past. [[user:Celestianpower|Cel]][[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,I liked her contributions to [[Proana]] a lot and encouraged her to keep up the good work when she felt it was unworthy and submitted it herself to AfD which was an act of intellectual honesty I had hardly seen before. She deserves the chance and her past history of vandalism is long gone. Please guys and girls... we have a nice and dedicated person here let's act from our feelings for once. We'll never gonna survive unless we get a little crazy! 
support,[[WP:ESP|e]]
support,I believe Purplefeltangel has learned from her mistakes and that they do not negate her overwhelming number of good contributions. 
support,I think that in the spirit of nobigdealadminship that this user deserves a [[WP:FAITH|good faith]] vote. Echoing Shauri... 
support,I don't see her abusing admin powers. 
support,This RFA would have been an easy promotion for Purplefeltangel if not for her actions on a single day. She's a mature useful and friendly editor.
support,This person is doing an excellent job here. Those oppose votes purturb me. 
support,A good lass she'll go far. 
support,She has made a good impression on me.
support,I'm willing to give PFA a vote of confidence here. 
support,A display of vandalism as newbie is not enough to convince me that she won't do good work as an admin. 
support,that vandalism was more than three months ago. In that time she's made good edits as points out. Everyone is a newbie once and is allowed a bad day in my opinion. 
support,this good editor. 
support,Per above. Very kind editor.[[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,Agreee with the nomination. A newbie test/vandalism early on in the career should not mean a life sentence. 
support,although I like mathematics and anime. Comparing this here with other nominations for example on this page I have to say that there seems to be an obvious doublestandard for votes. 
support,without reservation. I don't think this will pass now but I'm more than willing to let some fleeting vandalism go in this case.
support,She has always been fair and bright in AfDs in which I have seen her involvment and I forgive her vandalism. She potentially could be a good admin on wikipedia for the next 60 years. 
support,Per everybody above. Wonderful user.
support,S♥pport. 
oppose,Strong oppose Vandalized too recently <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Harry_Potter_and_the_HalfBlood_Prince&diff=prev&oldid=18936263 here>. Nominee even strong opposed her own rfa saying "I am the nominee and I have never met this person before. I have no idea who he is and why he's referring to me as a "gentleman." I think this was not a goodfaith nomination. And Cryptic is absolutely right; I have vandalized a page so why should I be an admin? ♥purplefeltangel 20:26 20 July 2005 (UTC)". User talk space could use a little more activity. 
oppose,No sorry. Vandalism too recent. 
oppose,Vandalizsed a high profile article right after the book came out this does she know how many people might have seen that? If this person can be an admin so cann I since I never "vandalized" any pages like not alttering their contenxts with malfeasance (I just learned that word in English). I swear if this goes through she must repay me the favor and nomminate me for admin I think I have about 1200 edits (I think).
oppose,; the vandalism kills it for me. As for the counterargument that this "pretty much bans anyone who's ever messed up from adminship" I agree; Wikipedia has hundreds of admins and hundreds more waiting to take their place. As for Wiki brah's vote above this can be disregarded; the user is a waste. The last I heard it was a sockpuppet of the banner user Rainbowwarrior1977 <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive48#Rainbowwarrior1977.2C_Wiki_brah.2C_.26_Shelburne_Kismaayo> although in the nontransparent way that Wikipedia tends to do this kind of thing it's not apparent if this is still the general opinion. Should be banned anyway and will never ever be an admin.
oppose,she has been a decent editor as of late but still not enough time passed. Also template used for a signature is a Bad Thing. I endorse her dislike for Harry Potter though. 
oppose,Weak oppose. I hate to do this but I have to agree that this vandalism is not that good... it kinda makes me question the maturity of purplefeltangel (though I still think she's an awesome person from what I've seen on the Wiki and on IRC). Anyways I dislike Harry Potter three =) But just try not to let your personal opinions dictate what you do on the Wiki and that'll be enough for me. 
oppose,Weak oppose per . 
oppose,Doesn't seem to be serious about the project. 
oppose,per vandalism. 
oppose,Weak oppose sorry from 'poacher to gamekeeper' in two months is just too much for me. But keep up the good work (and you are going great work) for another couple of months and I'll be delighted to change this to a strong support. 
oppose,The vandalism was just too blantant and done to a rather popular page. It does not matter how long ago it was to me. People who have vandalized and then "learned from their mistakes" should set up a new account. 
oppose,vandalism too recent. 
oppose,There are plenty of good editors who would love to be admins that haven't vandalized. 
oppose,Too soon. To me there is a [[statute of limitations]] for vandalism but not yet. Maybe you could ask [[Santa Claus]] for adminship for [[Christmas]] 
oppose,Better reapplying a little bit later. 
oppose,I find the vandalism to Harry Potter and the HalfBlood Prince particularly bothersome as that has been a page very heavily vandalized lately and one that I personally have been involved in trying to protect so I do find it a little annoying that that was her selected target. However I might be willing to look past that however some of the comments I have seen in this RfA to other users has demonstrated to me a level of maturity that I do not personally feel suits adminship. 
oppose,I personally feel that anyone using a transcluded signature hasn't taken the time to appreciate the drain it puts on our servers. I'm afraid that reading through all the comments so far I find Purplefeltangels' editcountitis to be far too extreme. 
oppose,The vandalism is troubling but not the only problem I have supporting this nomination. Purplefeltangel seems to be overly emotional. I like to poke fun at other wikipedians from time to time but she seemed to take any sarcastic comment about others as if she was personally insulted. Add to that the fact that she's only 14 and I'm going to have to oppose this nomination. Don't take it personally Purplefeltangel. 
oppose,The vandalism really destroyed her chances showed that she needs more experience.May the Force be with you! 
oppose,Without comment. 
oppose,the statutue of limitations as it were on vandalism may toll with enough experience and time. Not yet. 
oppose,for the reasons I stated above for . As a new person I'd like admins to be here a while longer before they are admins. 
oppose,I worked on the Harry Potter page she messed up. If she only did that once you could call it an experiment but she kept doing it after she was warned and asked to stop. That was only a few weeks ago. She needs to grow a bit and undo more vandalism before being given admin powers in my opinion. 
oppose,while Purplefeltangel does good work around here the vandalism thing is too recent. Though we must all forgive and forget less than three months in my opinion is insufficient time given that there were multiple vandalisms that occured even after warnings. | [[User talk:Flcelloguy|A note? ]]</font color>| 
oppose,a dislike of Harry Potter is certainly not a bad thing vandalising the article however within recent editing history is unforgiveable. 
oppose,oppose Cannot support sucha recent vandal. 
oppose,While promoting this editor might prove to be an interesting investment the timing for the nomination is clearly not the best. Also while I do not have any particular qualms concerning the age of editors in general it is of my belief that it does not act as a pro in this case. Maturity is a highly relative concept but regardless of how mature one is emotional maturity does depend a lot on age and life experience and that's generally the kind of maturity an active admin needs. To put it in a clearer manner I do not fully believe that she would be able to deal calmly with a highly stressful situation. Why rush things over? Try again in halfadozen months (I'm certain you'll be renominated earlier than that though). 
oppose,Extreme Oppose Recent vandal dosen't help new users (see: ) and that was after our argument ended peacefully however she forgave me for my argument with her so I have to say Weak Oppose (this is not based at all on my past argument with purplefeltangel) Edit:She entered what! 8 year olds read that article! Changing to extreme oppose 
oppose,Oppose NOT weakly. Only weeks ago this candidate repeatedly inserted [[penis]] into Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince because she doesn't like them. She continued to do this after FOUR separate talk page warnings and only stopped when told she was going to be blocked. She had been here over a year when she did this recent vandalism much more than long enough to know this is not OK. She picked an article especially popular with young people to vandalize in this way knowing other children would see it. I could support a 14 yearold editor who acts more mature than her years but we have enough admins who act less than their ages already. 
support,Good [[Wikipedia:Maintenance|maintainance]] work. 
support,I've seen some work before including some of the NGE work mentioned below and I'm happy to support. 
support,I have seen some of his edits and they seem good enough for sysop access. We can always use janitors. 
oppose,Great work so far but i still think Pyrop needs more experience working in and with the community here. i will probably support at a later date once more experience is acquired. 
oppose,Second Kingturtle. Pyrop needs more experience. 
oppose,I think you handled Kris45 badly as I explained in the RfC talk page. I think you need a much stronger commitment to dialogue and an understanding of what wikis are. I don't see that you have any broader problem so this is a very weak vote against and if you remind me in a month I'll reconsider check your talk page and support you if you don't make it this time.
support,I saw some of the edits. 
support,[[WP:ESP|e]]
support,Has enough edits has been here long enough. 
support,An ideal admin. 
support,Sounds good to me. I think a user's contribs speak broader than his answers to the standard questions here and should note that Uncle G got a plethora of support votes before answering them and have seen no reason to regret adminning him. 
oppose,Far too many Wikipedia namespace edits too early. I suggest a long period of article editing to improve this editor's editing experience and broaden his perspectives. 
oppose,Over the past two days despite being active here (over 150 edits since his nomination!) this user has ignored this RfA even after repeated notices on his Talk page. If he's not interestedthat's fine but the civil thing to do is let us know one way or the other. Would people seeking his help as an admin also expect to be ignored this way? Note that only 1.5% of his edits are in the User_talk namespace. 
support,RadioKirk is a hard working member of the Wikipedia community who has been strongly involved in reverting vandalism and helping to make articles better. I think by making him a SysOp it will allow him to better protect Wikipedia from vandalism.
support,admin is supposed to be no big deal so I support him/her.
support,He'll be a great sysop. 
support,We need more vandalexterminators with admin powers. This user seems to have a good feel for what's vandalism whats NPOV and seems to know the difference between vandalism and unfamiliarity with Wikipedia policy. 
oppose,Not enough experience sorry. 
oppose,for now. You make good use of edit summaries decent vandalismspotting and demonstrated a good sense of what's notable (and what's not). Having a narrow focus on articles isn't a problem but you need some more experience before being made an admin: I suggest that you participate a little more in the Wikipediaspace and continue doing what you've been doing. [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
oppose,Few wiki namespace edits. 
oppose,Lacking experience in project related areas such as categories templates and policies. 
oppose,RadioKirk does indeed do good work on a collection of articles but it is a fairly narrow set of articles (as he says himself) relatively few edits (around 500 in total) and there's not much in the Wikipedia namespace either: http://faleg.org/cgibin/wannabe_kate?username=RadioKirk&site=en.wikipedia.org Perhaps better to wait for a while get more under your belt? Thanks/
oppose,This user seems to be an excellent editor who I am sure will eventually make an great admin. I see from his response below that he is taking the opposition in the spirit it is intended. Please continue to do good work here as being a good editor is more important than being an admin. I too had my RfA rejected 3 months ago and am striving to continue to contribute to the article namespace as well as participating in the Wikipedia namespace. 
oppose,per above. 
oppose,not nearly enough experience on Wikipedia. I note that your user page says you are 15 years old. That in itself is not a problem but it makes it rather unlikely that you have a law degree (or that you are married to Pamstar) and lying on your RFA application doesn't go down well.
oppose,Less than 30 days and I am concerned about these edits which were made in the past 3 weeks: <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Casito/Archive_1&diff=prev&oldid=19457557> <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Casito/Archive_1&diff=prev&oldid=19354956>. In that I don't expect to see rfa candidates labelling other people's user talk pages as candidates for speedy deletion. 
oppose,due to recent virulent conflict with [[user:Casito]]... basically the same reasoning given by plus the answer to question 3 below seems to me indicative of a temperment wholly unsuited for the powers an administrator is equipped with. 
oppose,user has just started out. 
oppose,I am glad that is user is eager to help Wiki to short of timespan to be nominated and doesnt meet the at least 1000 edit mark which is more important for experience and not edit counting. Also any editor can do these: Factchecking information dealing with vandals and trolls which I think are notable admirations and hope they still have them when they return wim more exp. [[Special:Contributions/Who|&infin;]]
oppose,No. Looking at the candidate answers and profile this needs no explanation. 
oppose,I have to agree with Harro looking at the responses below to the questions asked makes me feel a bit uneasy giving this user the keys to the Wikikingdom. 
oppose,Sorry but less than 100 edits (let alone 1000) one month and well somewhat dubious answers leave me with little option. 
oppose,and delist. This nomination is nothing more than trolling and anyone who follows Rfa should remember [[Rainbowwarrior1977]]'s previous badfaith nomination of . 
oppose,Oppose in the Strongest Possible Terms. (Just in case.) User lacks the experience and knowledge of policy necessary to be an admin and if his interactions with other users over this RfA are any indication of his ability to communicate with others he lacks the communication skills necessary to be an admin. Delist and if there is a pattern of such activities (as is indicated by the commentary above) refer to appropriate authorities (ArbCom?) for disciplinary action. 
oppose,and delist. Spurious attempt that cheapens the process 
oppose,wholly inappropriate given the answer to (3) > ( | | 
oppose,An administrator coming in with the agenda noted in question 3 is far too great a risk. It reminds me of a Senator who stood up with a list of 200 names. 
oppose,For a minute I thought the Playboy model on Sepia tone was you. Obviously not your image there has been removed. Anyway as per Denelson83 but I will oppose until you rephrase this nomination properly. 
oppose,Interesting description. In fact it was just last night that I asked myself "Why don't more Playboy bunnies contribute to Wikipedia?" [[User Talk:Acetic Acid|Acetic]]
oppose,The nomination is strange and the contributions don't seem specially significant. As for Playboy models one Finnish Playboy model is a very prominent novel and screenplay writer so why shouldn't Playboy models contribute to Wikipedia? 
oppose,Oppose. Lack of edit summaries. You could have at least bothered to put an edit summary when nominating yourself. 
oppose,for now. Answer to standard question #1 indicates that the candidate doesn't have a good idea of what he's applying for and the content and general tone of the nomination indicates he's not taking this very seriously which is rather puzzling. If this changes I may reevaluate my vote. 
oppose,User selfadmittedly has 'no idea' what being an administrator entails has only a few edits to the Wikipedia and Talk namespaces and fails to follow the syntax for setting up RfAs. Also your 'summary' of yourself is a bit excessively long you could move most of that onto your user page. You should read up a bit more on policy and participate more in the community and I'd happily support in a few months' time. 
oppose,Until you give a general description of yourself I shall abstain from this vote. [[User talk:Denelson83|83]] 04:08 6 September 2005 (UTC) Opposing this candidate for his nonstandard application. 
oppose,This editor appears to mean well but does not appear to understand what adminship involves. 
oppose,per Friday. He also seems to be too verbose (this is an RfA not a user subpage) and I'm always a little leery of people who need to debunk every one of their oppose/neutral votes. 
oppose,per everyone especially . Wow what a long profile </sup/><p style="fontfamily: Bradley Hand ITC Comic Sans MS;">
oppose,Actions speak louder than words and you have too much on this page. 
support,I'd say being here a year and having over 5000 edits is experience enough... nothing in contribs suggests he would misuse admin priviliges which must be the only consideration. 
support,Need more admins. This is an encyclopedia first a community second. [[User_talk:Brian0918|0918]]
support,support. Per Brian. His encyclopedia edits cancel out his low WP space activity. 
support,Plenty of experience. 
support,I was looking at this nomination to see if it should be removed early. But looking at Mr. Norton's reasoning for wanting to be an admin seems like a fine (if smallbut many bricks make a wall) contribution to the overall advance of historical writing. Unless someone can show me that think he will abuse adminship I wish the opposers would reconsider. 
support,unlikely to abuse admin tools. 
support,Strong This guy is a great editor an ambassador for wikipedia. He may not have the usertalk or project edits but he actively speaks to people outside of wikipedia for permissions and for research purposes. Too much I see wikipedia as just being a regurgitation of things that can be found on google we need more of these editors. If he believes adminship will help him in his contributions then I think he should get it. I would hate for him to switch over to RC patrol or CVU to get more "community" edits. Keep on doing what you are doing. Like Cecropia above I wish opposers would reconsider. 
support,per above. 
support,you don't need to be a computer geek with the ability to properly list your RFA the first time in order to be an administrator. 
support,Very Strong He's a cool guy. He will be a good Admin. Let's vote for him! 
support,Technoilliterate Geezer I'd rather have an admin who can COMMUNICATE effectively than an inarticulate semiliterate techno geek. Besides the admin corps has enough Wiz Kidz with 133t sk1llz. It needs more Geezers who can write.:>
support,User has made some valuable contributions and seems quite unlikely to abuse tools. 
support,this is the first editor I have seen in a while who has even mentioned copyright and sourcing in articles on an RfA. We need more help at [[WP:CP]]. If the community is not ready for this user to become an administrator this time around then I earnestly hope that the next time around it will be. All the concerns listed here can be rectified given enough time and patience. 
oppose,inexperience shows when he tried to list his selfnom check [[WP:RFA]] history. 
oppose,Richard is doing better than he did initially but I'm not ready to say I trust him with administrator privileges. 
oppose,Lack of wiki namespace edits and talk edits 
oppose,Weak oppose. The user recently blanked his talk page. Please explain why you did this. 
oppose,I realise that this user has heaps of encylopedia edits but with only 9 project edits the user probably wouldn't be able to do any admin tasks anyway. I will support in a couple of months if the user makes way more project edits. 
oppose,He appears to be a solid editor but with hardly any WP: or talk participation I don't think he's been tested in interactions with other users very much. Although with all of his contributions to images helping other users navigate the jargon at [[Wikipedia:Image copyright tags]] might be a good place to start along with the usual AfD CfD RfD and TfD areas. Given more participation there and more consistent use of edit summaries I would probably support in a few months. (I like your user name also!) 
oppose,see [[:Commons:Village_pump#Is_this_Commons_material.3F]] just an illustration of his unfamiliarity with the project. The user contributes great and well researched articles (sometimes maybe too obscure). But I don't believe he needs admin powers for that. 
oppose,User does excellent edits but should enter the policy namespace and get comfortable there before beginning to operate as an admin. Would happily support in a few months if he has done so. Learn to ride a regular bike before you hop on a motorcycle. 
oppose,per Improv. NB:I realize that I had voted before and that vote was stricken without good reason or notice to me. See my comment below. I ask the striker please to account. User needs more namespace experience. Great article writers who are very unfamiliar with policy don't make good admins. Happy to support in future if his projectspace participation increases. 
oppose,The tone of this RFA gives me a great deal of pause regarding whether this user would be a suitable admin. The supposition that you need to become an admin before you can get your feet wet in "admintypetasks" particularly makes me think the user hasn't looked around a lot outside the space of his articles. 
support,This <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=T%C5%99i_o%C5%99%C3%AD%C5%A1ky_pro_Popelku&diff=prev&oldid=20682103 edit> where Rl caught a spam hidden under seemingly valid name serves as example why. 
support,Unequivocally support. A highly committed (insert joke here) and responsible user who would make a fine admin. He's being particlularly helpful to me dealing with a vandal. 10:08 21 August 2005 (UTC)<br>Oh and willingness to admit potential deficiencies/problems demonstrates maturity that the wiki desperately needs. It is admirable that he has declared what he is uncomfortable with. Opposing honesty is absolutely disgraceful. 
support,We need more hands and this is a safe pair in which to shove a mop. 
support,Looks like a good and experienced wikipedian.May the Force be with you! 
support,good editor wikipedia will be better off if he has admin powers. 
support,He knows his way around and is trustworthy. 
support,Great editor hand this fellow a mop. 
support,not least for the wikifascist label. If the idiots are shooting at you you know you're doing something right. 
support,see no good reason to object. 
support,Good editor carries himself very professionally. 
support,Some phenomenal catches including most recently at the [[Boston Massachusetts|Boston]] article. And making the awful into the readable is an important goal. 
support,Suppport Yes I spelled it with three p's on purpose. 
support,Earlier today I was browsing past here and didn't vote because I didn't really have an opinion but later looking at my watchlist I noticed that RI just categorized an article I rewrote. I like to think that my revision left it somewhere above awful but at least now I know it's good ;). 
support,5000 edits to article space does enormous amounts of good work on RC patrol has knowledge of policy and to use the memorable characterization above is "not stupid or insane."—
support,I endorse Rl's view on consensus. 
support,Good editor. 
support,Good contributions and I appreciate his honesty in answering the candidate questions. 
support,Editor clearly understands Wikipedia policy far better than the hordes opposing him. 
support,agree with Kelly Martin's comment. 
support,Checks out as a good editor. The "misunderstanding the notion of consensus" is in my opinion minor and fixable. I'm happy to support this candidate. | [[User_talk:Linuxbeak|Talk]] | 
oppose,Answer to Hamster Sandwich fundamentally misunderstands the notion of consensus. It's not the same as unanimity. Answer to first question sounds like he's not very keen on doing adminrelated things. Doesnt' really sound very proactive either. Supposed to be nobigdeal but some interest would be nice! Whilst VfD closures are often controversial it is surprising to list a single debate which didn't go the 'right' way as an important conflict. 
oppose,Weak Oppose I endorse Splash's comments completely. I'm going to tell you the same thing I told another candidate last week. In your answers you trash yourself and your work. You're fishing for compliments or rather support votes. Plus your comment that "Everyone does it <revert vandalism>. My English always warned us about using words such as all never and every. I doubt vandals revert vandalism. 
oppose,user has too weak a grasp of Wikipolicy. 
oppose,Great contributions and fine edit summaries but I am also perturbed by the candidate's interpretation of consensus. I don't like the statement: "I freely admit that I wouldn't be comfortable closing a contentious VfD". 
oppose,consensus doesn't necessarily mean unanimity. 
oppose,Whether the admission of discomfort with the prospect of closing a contentious VfD reflects a lack of confidence in the ability to do it well or a lack of desire to do it at all I don't know. Both possibilities though strike me as a sign of not being cut out to be an administrator. 
oppose,strange understanding of cosensus. 
oppose,I'd prefer not to oppose but his comments aren't really what I want to see from a candidate. I'd like to see more willingness to make mistakes and also to admit them. 
oppose,Agree with comments above. 
oppose,I think Rl is a fine editor but he needs to research policy if he doesn't know it (with reference most especially to [[Wikipedia: Consensus|consensus]] but also evident in other remarks by him). Perhaps we could have another look at this in a couple of months if Rl delves into policy a tad more. 
oppose,Weak Oppose. The 100% concept of consensus allows a liberum veto for POV warriors and trolls. Will change vote to Neutral if candidate can explain that this eccentric view of consensus will not intefere with admin role. 
oppose,Consensus etc. 
oppose,Sorry to say but I waited till I was able to guage the comments that have been coming in concerning my question. If you had said 65% or 70% or 75% some concrete number I might have voted for your promotion. Adminship should be at least partially about accountability to the community. 
oppose,As much as I hate the "consensus" terminology that has been introduced in VfD closures there is a lot more here: It is necessary to get rid of trash to revert vandals and to obey consensus (66% is the threshold used by US legislators). This is not because of "deletionism" or "inclusionism" or any other dadblamed "ism." This is because encyclopedias are tertiary reference sources and anything that gets even a large delete vote is probably not suitably dead and cold to be part of an encyclopedia. 
support,Why of course. 
support,[[Soup|]] I'm supporting hopefully user will accept the nomination. 
support,again. Good user good person goodgasell! 
support,Promised myself that I wasn't going to vote until my RfA was over but Rob deserves my early support. 
support,Good egg. Good luck! 
support,exactly as before: "Going by previous interaction I expect he'll treat admin rights carefully and thoughtfully." 
support,eminently trustworthy. Should be an excellent admin. 
support,Supp Ort. I keep seeing him around.~ 
support,Goes without saying. 
support,he isn't one? 
support,good editor. 
support,After reading what others have posted and looking through some of the user contributions I feel this would be a fine admin.

support,death to unqualified Fair Use! 
support,Good edit count.
support,as per . 
support,unless there is some basis for opposition that I am not finding. 
support,Plenty of edits answered the questions.
support,I'm going to assume good faith based on the response below to that the num is familiar w/ policy and will further his efforts there (note: I am in no way saying that good faith is not being assumed elsewhere I'm just impressed by the response to a valid concern) | [[User Talk:Lomn|Talk]] / 
support,Looks good. 
support,Good editor member of the [[Wikipedia:Elements of Style improvement project|Elements of Style improvement project]]. ;) 
oppose,till user specifies an email id. 
oppose,I think that an admintobe should have good experience of adminrelated areas before being given the tools to effect decisions in those areas. The edit count really is just too low on all the interaction areas from User talk: to Wikipedia: to be able to judge how the candidate responds in a crisis or when under attack (as he most surely will be as an admin!). If you don't currently feel "comfortable" with the tasks you'd be able to carry out I think it'd be better to wait until you are comfortable and then ask for the tools. I imagine if you come back in a couple of months with some presence 'behindthescenes' you'd have a pretty easy ride here. Meantime you can grab Sam Hocevar's Godmode lite and get a oneclick rollback that way. 
oppose,Per Splash and the fact his answers here are extremely cursory. 
oppose,Your lack of edits in the User talk: namespace is quite low and you have only had 18 sections on your own talk page. If you can show community interaction I will support in a few months. 
oppose,Article edits seem fine but far too few WP namespace edits for me to support. 
oppose,for now due to lack of experience. 
oppose,Conversational skills are crucial for an admin. Lack of Talk/User_talk edits and his terse answers below indicate someone who may be a good editor but avoids interaction as much as possible. Admins are public figures around here; I think would have a tough time handling the barrage of questions debates taunting and accusations that admins face on a daily basis. 
support,as nominator. 
oppose,only slightly over 1000 edits and only 16 in the Wikipedia namespace. Also most edits seem to be minor without edit summaries. 
oppose,Salvag has wiped his/her talk page twice (last week and again today) without ever having replied (on a talk page at least) to any comment left by anyone. Most of the removed comments were critical and requested an explanation or action. Salvag I'm not implying it was done in bad faith because I can see you did act on some of the suggestions made but it still doesn't provide evidence of the sort of participation in the Wiki community I expect from an admin. Only 9 edits total in the User talk: namespace. 
oppose,as above. 
oppose,as per Veledan. 
oppose,As per Veledan. 
oppose,per everyone. Also user talk pgae is blank :( </sup/><p style="fontfamily: Bradley Hand ITC Comic Sans MS;">
oppose,As per Veledan. 
oppose,too soon you have too few edits in the time you have been here and talk page concerns are discouraging. In time you'll get into the flow of talk page discussions. 
oppose,As per Veledan. 
support,As the nominator it will suprise nobody that I think Sam is worthy of the proverbial mop and bucket. 
support,I second it 
support,Good job on the cricket articles. 
support,I don't usually vote for folks I have no interaction with but jguk saying it'd be useful for cricket fine with me. And tat template rule nonsense below? That's exactly what templates should be used for. 
support,Obvious dedication to Wikipedia handled himself quite well in the VFD. I doubt there would be any issue with giving him admin rights. 
support,He has done a lot of work in the cricket realm. 
support,A dedicated and responsible editor. 
support,see comments below. 
support,I've reviewed his user pages and checked through some of his contributions and I conclude he's ready. (Plus we Norwegians have to stick together.) 
support,Cool. 
support,The rational used by those voting oppose seems weak at best. 
support,An all round good guy. 
support,has sufficient experience to say he will be a good admin. 
support,A good writer of articles. 
support,Meets . Lack of WP: edits is a concern but Sam's answers to the standard questions and responses to comments lead me to believe he will make good use of the mop. 
support,The whole thing about rules is really not applicable here. He violated a convention and a not terribly important one at that. 
support,I ask one question when voting on RfAs. "Would Wikipedia lose anything by the promotion?" I don't know how much WP would gain by Sam's being an admin although I hope it would be a lot but I do know that WP would not get worse. He has my confidence. And he's the Norweigan cricket fan. 
support,to counterweigh against the oppose votes of the wikilawyers and the deletionist society. Sigh. 
support,Seems to be a fine user. I couldn't make much sense of the oppose votes. 
support,Yes please. 
support,like him. 
oppose,Srongly oppose: "even if there were some rules broken" pretty much says it all. We need less of that. Get the rules changed if you believe in it strongly. Otherwise obey them because when administrators start trashing rules for their own ideologies we get the nastiest wars of all. 
oppose,strong focus on only editing cricket pages suggests that he does not need admin powers. 
oppose,somewhat reluctantly. A good contributor with a prominent nominator. I oppose not because of "the rules" thing since that's minor. However with only 100 or so edits to Wikipedia: space and the same to Wikipedia talk: space he has only a passing acquaintance with what admins do. Answer to question 1 doesn't seem to show particular enthusiasm for doing what admins do either. Nothing wrong with discussion on VfD pages by the way! 
oppose,for lack of experience in Wikipedia namespace. However I do want to state that the "rules broken" issue about templates was in fact a goodfaith attempt by Sam to streamline a number of articles so I would ask people to not hold that against him. 
oppose,but more for the reasons given by Encephalon and Acetic Acid in their neutral votes than for much of the dicussion above this line. 
oppose,Very strongly oppose. I'm all for low standards for adminship but when someone writes articles like [[England Women v Australia Women 2427 August 2005|this]] it says to me that the author has no understanding whatsoever of NPOV or the Manual of Style. Such a person really should not be an administrator at least at this point in time. 
oppose,I have to agree with Ambi. 
oppose,I'm agreeing with Ambi too. He doesn't seem to have a good grasp on the differences between Wikipedia and other Wikimedia projects namely Wikinews. He's written all of these articles on regularseason cricket matches that are much better suited for Wikinews (and I've told him this on VfD discussions for those) yet he and the other cricket editors insist on keeping them here when that level of detail in covering a cricket season is not really that necessary in this wiki. Nevertheless I do think it's a good idea to have admins who have fields of expertise to which they are willing to contribute a lot (I've supported several candidates based on that reason); but I also think that he should explore other namespaces such as WP: and articles on other topics. 
oppose,Yikes. Wasn't planning on voting until I saw [[England Women v Australia Women 2427 August 2005]]. Written like a news article certainly not presented in an encyclopedic fashion ("a paltry 131"? "tailend heroics"?). I'm not sure this "article" is even appropriate for Wikipedia but that's another matter. In any case I cannot see how one so unfamiliar with Wikipedia practice and policies (or who is familiar but chooses to ignore them) could be considered a suitable candidate for adminship. If I had come across this on RC patrol I would think it the work of a new/anonymous user not think it the work of someone seeking adminship. 
oppose,almost never puts [[edit summary|edit summaries]] see <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&hideminor=0&namespace=&target=SamuraiClinton&limit=500&offset=0>. There are many other reasons to oppose Samurai's candidacy but this one is close to my heart (close enough to not even wait for Samurai to even say if s/he desires the adminship). 
oppose,Too suspicious nomination. No edit summaries no answer to candidacy and seems to be conflictive. 
oppose,(I'll take the answers to the questions below as an implicit acceptance of the nomination.) Many reasons are listed at his [[Wikipedia:Requests for comment/SamuraiClinton|RfC]]. SamuraiClinton either does not understand the concept of consensus or chooses to ignore it when it doesn't suit his needs as evidenced at the VfD discussion for [[Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Autosexuality|Autosexuality]] (in particular <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AVotes_for_deletion%2FAutosexuality&diff=12254081&oldid=12253938> and <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AVotes_for_deletion%2FAutosexuality&diff=12261269&oldid=12254081>). 
oppose,per all the above; no need for repetition. 
oppose,I believe that an Admin needs to exhibit a sincere and helpful state of mind. This can not be expressed in words but in deeds. I do think that has this potential but is being influenced by others. Too bad. Be yourself and grow. Stupid me if I'm wrong on this. 
oppose,Nothing personal mind you. Sam is currently the subject of a rather lively request for comment on behavior that can best be described as idiosyncratic. 
oppose,Needs to do more edit summaries; idiosyncratic behaviour described in RfC suggests that SamuraiClinton is still getting the hang of Wikipedia operation. Answers to questions below seem to indicate a lack of interest in adminship anyway. 
oppose,SamuraiClinton might be a good admin some time in the future but right now he simply lacks the maturity and commonsense required (see the [[Wikipedia:Requests for comment/SamuraiClinton|Request for Comments on him]]). I also have very great reservations about the motives of the nominator. Finally his answers to the candidate questions are not very good. 
oppose,This is an absurd nomination. 
oppose,SamuraiClinton is eager to contribute and full of good intentions but he has made a fair number of blunders. He needs to settle down a little. 
oppose,all my reasons have already been said. 
oppose,Seems like basically a good person who tries to add good content to WP but his articles are often VfDed or speedied particularly as neologisms which suggests he needs more time to get used to WP before adminship. Also a nomination by an anon/new user is worrying though I'm not sure it should be considered a sockthere'd be no reason for it as selfnoms are allowed. In addition responses to the questions below indicate that Sam is only interested in editing and creating articles neither of which need admin privileges. 
oppose,Specious nomination. The nominator should be censured. 
oppose,OPPOSE. Sorry for screaming but this vote is not difficult. I've looked into s contributions and have decided that this person is not one with which to trust with administratorship at this time. It's lt's nothing personal it's just business. 
oppose,While I'm still prepared to [[Wikipedia:Assume good faith|assume good faith]] and regard SamuraiClinton's contributions as not malicious the points raised in [[Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/SamuraiClinton]] clearly indicate he's not yet mature for adminship. 
oppose,Sockpuppetry unauthorized closure of VfD and a slew of absurd contributions. Erratic to say the least. I think he's shown a rather selective lack of comprehension and deserves no good faith presumption at this point but of course even that presumption would not sustain this nomination. 
oppose,because of reasons stated above. 
oppose,Oppose. SamuraiClinton's contributions to date do not yet indicate a good understanding of Wikipedian consensus or good technical skills with respect to editing or following procedure. He should not be proposed for sysop until he is generally regarded as a reliable contributor which at this writing he is not. Generally speaking I would not think people should expect to be appointed admins while they have an active RFC criticizing them. 
support,NazismIsntCool didn't give the customary free first vote so I'm placing it here for him. | [[User_talk:Linuxbeak|Talk]] | 
support,You need a good administrator before you can have a good wiki and you shouldn't just take any candidate. 
oppose,OpposeStrong OpposeVery Strong Oppose. I'm really sorry I hate starting off an RFA like this. Scott I think you show potential but I can't justify voting support when you've got virtually as many edits to your user page as you do to articles. Plus you haven't made much use of the edit summary at all which in my book (as well as others) is a big nono. You obviously have been here for a while; it also appears you are the creator of [[Wikipedia:Votes for deletion policy]] (which is good!). If this nomination fails come back in a month after doing some more stuff use that edit summary much more liberally and break 1000 edits. I will most likely vote support for you then. | [[User_talk:Linuxbeak|Talk]] | 
oppose,Not only does he not meet I think all the comments about vandalism etc. do not make me believe Scott will exercise good judgment and maturity as an admin. Sorry Scott keep up the good work but I don't think you'd be a good admin 
oppose,weak Oppose I can't put my finger on precisely why but I just don't have a good feeling about Scott as an administrator. I was tempted to vote neutral because I'm haven't had huge amounts of interation with him but his edit count is on the low side and the comments from other users in this and the previous request don't encourage me. This isn't an altime vote so when you have more experience and a higher profile I will gladly recondisder in any future request. 
oppose,I can't put my finger on it either but something just seems like he won't use good judgement. 
oppose,From his : "If I ever get sysop status I will chase down every vandal and make sure they pay dearly for their actions". In my view blocking powers and such are simply to prevent vandalism to Wikipedia not punish vandals. Vandals should be encouraged to reform their behavior not be punished. Also Scott could you explain your ? You've used them <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Vikreykja&diff=prev&oldid=13904475 more> <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Apollomelos&diff=prev&oldid=13877053 than> <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Vikreykja&diff=prev&oldid=13904475 once> despite the [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Arcadian|objections]] (scroll down) of other editors. As you note you don't meet your own criteria and I do not believe I could vote for someone who doesn't believe he would make a good administrator ("This means I oppose myself.") Don't get me wrong ScottI'm glad you're helping out Wikipedia and you're doing a good job. I just don't think adminship is right for you; there are other ways in which you can better help out. 
oppose,I can't support someone who doesn't meet his own admin criteria. 
oppose,This is where your admin criterion is really gonna bite you in the ass. Also I really didn't want to know that you're uncircumcised. That's a bit too much [[TMI]]...shows a lack of maturity. 
oppose,. Your admin criteria shows an extreme lack of [[WP:FAITH|good faith]]. 
oppose,Strongly oppose due to the hate list. 
oppose,Besides the comments made by the other opposing votes this user has yet to answer the question I [[User talk:Scott Gall/Admin criterion#Question about your Admin criterion|asked here]]. 
oppose,A cursory glance at his user page shows that his politics are as dubious as they were last time. I do not believe this user can act with impartiality or carry out policy (he seems to think that personal attacks are acceptable for example). 
oppose,From user page writes: "[[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|Point of view]] should be allowed in moderation in articles where some parts are unknown. [[Wikipedia:Edit war|Edit wars]] should also be justified in this case." Clearly does not understand the fundamental principle of Wikipedia. 
oppose,Very strong oppose. Vandalises other language Wikipedias. 
oppose,I wouldn't have minded a 'reformed vandal' so much but the fact that you keep around is quite childish. Also you don't fit your own standards for becoming an admin. 
oppose,the above comments are troubling. 
oppose,and now I hate you too. 
oppose,Our friend here needs to gain some maturity and a firmer grip on reality before requesting adminship. 
oppose,Was this even a serious nomination? 
oppose,Userpage is confrontational and shows immaturity. 
oppose,this guy actually is proud of being of vandal..he keeps a "museum" of his stupid vandalism. 
support,Grant him the mop. 
support,Not all admins have to be active all the time. There are over 1000 500 of them and some of them are not very active. It doesn't mean that they don't do good work. There is no reason that any user who has some experience in wikipedia and has shown that they can be trusted shouldn't be an admin. 
support,2200 edits is more than enough. 
support,because we need more good admins! 
support,confident that he will not misuse admin powers. 
support,I don't know this editor much so I sample checked some of their edits and all seems fine to me. 
support,ScottyBoy's edits speak for themselves. His edits are quality and while he has quantity going for him as well it is the quality of his edits that wins my vote of support. 
support,as per Caponer Alf. 
support,Scotty just sent me a request on my own talk page about supporting his adminship. 
support,I see no reason to not support him.
support,We had a slight disagreement recently but he was most reasonable about it. I'm sure he will be an excelent admin and try to do what is right. 
support,Really good user and I often find his analysis of a photo on FPC exactly what I would say. Very nice guy and I certainly don't think that his edits are not enough. You can't expect someone to always to be active most people (I think) have a life aside from Wikipedia and can't be expected to be glued to the screen 24/7 (not that such users aren't extremely valuable). Anyway I agree totally with his idea's on diagrams on FPC in my opion they don't belong. 
support,I'm confident that he will be a valuable addition to the ranks of administrator. 
support,after all he's from Wild Wonderful [[West Virginia]]! 
support,That's hot. 
support,No substantial reason to oppose. "Campaigning for a delete vote" I have to say is quite routine and desirable admin behaviour. 
support,per Slac; putting in extra effort should be rewarded not punished. 
support,Selfawareness and humility as expressed in reaction to the opposition's comments below is how I know that an admin will strive to act responsibly and will work to correct mistakes. 
support,I think I was too hasty and harsh opposing. After taking a closer look at this editor's record I see a long time contributor who generally interacts well with others. 
support,See no substantive current issues. 
support,ScottyBoy900Q has rightly and judiciously raised questions about editors working on articles about themselves a very difficult issue that a lot of us haven't had the guts to touch. I don't see that as a reason to oppose. 
support,User meets my admin requirments on my userpage. 
support,Guy who's leading the opposition is retaliating. No spurious AfD almost half responses say he's nonnotable or borderline case. 
support,[[user:Celestianpower|Cel]][[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,With respect with the AFD incident everyone is allowed to have one bad day. And while RFA campaigning is a [[bad thing]] it does not strike me as a reason to oppose a candidate. 
support,Seems like a good editor reasons for oppose are lacking to say the least. 
oppose,[[Opera|Oppose]] Been here for over a year and only has over 2000 edits user doesn't seem active enough to me to be an admin. [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]] [[user talk:Private Butcher|Butcher]] 16:08 8 October 2005 (UTC) I now oppose for reasons that have been brought before me. 
oppose,A recent spurious AfD is a bad sign (and doesn't reflect knowledge of notability guidelines). (restored per Fawcett5) 
oppose,I withhold judgement about whether the above mentioned Vfd vote was spurious or not (the old Vfd vote was a resounding keep). However when ScottyBoy900Q set up the new Afd he simply overwrote the archive of the old discussion instead of creating a new Afd article. This to me clearly indicates that he has insufficient knowledge of administrative procedure at this time. I would be happy to reconsider my vote in a few months when he has demonstrated more knowledge about "the way of the wiki". 
oppose,I rarely oppose a nomination but feel I need to in this instance. What drew my attention in the first place was the [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/David Mertz]] incident. While one can see reasons for putting the article up for deletion I wan't very happy with the tone of the nomination and there is some evidence of campaigning for a delete vote which is unbecoming in a potential administrator. Also this is a selfnomination and there is evidence of campaigning for support allowable but it bothers me a little. All in all oppose this time round but hope to be able to support in a few months time. 
oppose,I'm not a big fan of RfA campaigning if this one fails I'd be happy to vote in support in a few weeks on an RfA without it. 
oppose,I think a prospective admin should have enough involvement in the community that they don't have to spam users talk pages soliciting votes It looks to me like bad form to cut and paste notes asking for support. It comes from a fairly narrow particapation history I think an admin needs to have wider experience to have the backround to act on policy. There isn't much work on some of the activities listed in the first question most don't need any admin powers to at least pitch in no reason to jump on in some of those backlogs! Vote reinstated after reading 's qoute and realizing that nominee challenged six of the voters he just doesn't show that he has any real grasp of policy/pratice here. 
oppose,For spamming of user pages alone. Is the RFA process turning into something akin to a US presidential campaign? 
oppose,Votes for self in selfnom and a cutnpaste AFD. 
oppose,for votepimping. 
oppose,based on comments above. 
oppose,not only do the AfD and the selfvote worry me but this comment from above to Lulu of the LotusEaters: People can see for themselves when looking at your arguments and the way you talk down to everyone what kind of person you are. It doesn't matter how heated the argument is or how frustrated you are but I don't expect admins to insult other [[Wikipedia:Wikipedians|Wikipedian]]s or to infer that someone is a bad person. While I feel you are a good contributer I just don't think you're ready yet. Thanks! | [[User talk:Flcelloguy|A note? ]]</font color>| 
oppose,I wasn't the b'crat who extended this (though I believe the extension merited) and I won't be the promoting or removing b'crat but as often happens with extensions nothing definitive has happened. Voting as an editor not as an admin I believe that the substantive objections in both content and number indicate that this nomination should be brought up again at a future time. 
support,per nom. 
support,Positive contributor. 
support,Evil He's been here since June (where did the 2 days idea come from?) and has more than 3000 edits. He's also selfdescribed as evil (see for his excellent logic). That's enough for me.
support,I think you did yourself a disservice by allowing an unknown member of the community to nominate; when people don't know you directly they often use the reputation of the nominator as a vouch for your good behaviour/intentions. Nonetheless you seem to do a lot of good work. Good luck. 
support,I see nothing in this editor's history to give me any pause. NormanEinstein: it was clear that Ian13's nomination was a surprise to Shaddack so I don't think it's a question of 'allowing'. Be that as it may we should evaluate the candidate on his own merits nobody else's. 
support,Be bold! 
support,Looks ok to me. Could edit more when feeling has good content to contribute. 
support,Seems fine was helpful with my request. 
support,This is a spoiler vote in opposition to those who oppose a nomination based on the nominator and not the nominated. There is currently space for an additional 8 spoiler votes. 
support,the reasons for opposition here are weak. We need more admins. 
support,no reason to believe this user will abuse admin powers. 
support,weak reasons for opposition to position that is "no big deal." I think user will be a fine admin.
oppose,Weak oppose A very good editor. However I'd have supported if Shaddack were more interactive with other users and in talk pages as well. I am also surprised by the action of the nominator Ian13. He's just joined 2 days ago! I'll follow up the comments here as this is may not be my definitive vote. 
oppose,as per Svest. 
oppose,Good mainspace contributions and reasonable Wikipedia: space contributions but extremely few of them. Kate's tool isn't relevant here; I can count them by hand. They are a few V/AfD edits and not much else. One of them is a merge during an otherwise deleting AfD. This is allowed per WP:BOLD I very well know but I don't like it being done since it renders all the other editor's opinions irrelevant unless someone is going to unmerge after the AfD. I think only one or two of them were 'engaging' edits i.e. not actually discussing but just stating his opinion. This is fine and what most people do in AfD but some debating/discussing is essential to be able to see how an editor conducts themselves. So I think I'd like to see considerably more user and community interaction just because there is too little on which to judge how Shaddack may respond when under pressure or in disgreement etc. Broaden your scope of participation a little see which behindthescenes stuff you do/don't like and how it does/doesn't work. 
oppose,per Splash. 
oppose,per Splash 
oppose,per Splash. 
oppose,due to extremely odd nomination: produced by 2day old account and did not sign their own acceptance. Sorry but that last point seems to show a lack of Wikipedia knowledge or attention to detail both important traits for an admin. 
oppose,for now. I would like to see him interact more on the talk pages. It is important to be able to see how he interacts with others in discussions. This probably explains his answer to number three below. Conflict with others is not a bad thing it is how you resolve the conflict which is what I want to see a key attribute of an admin. 
oppose,per Splash. 
oppose,This is a spoiler vote in opposition to those who make spoiler votes in opposition. There is currently space for an additional 0 spoiler votes. 
support,seems competent and levelheaded. 
support,Has been friendly & helpful with the Wikipedia 1.0 project. 
support,Excellent answers to the questions and seems very levelheaded and trustworthy. Good on edit summaries. Highly unlikely to abuse the admin powers. Seems like they would be very useful to her. And all in all a quality contributor. I see no reason to oppose. 
support,Edit count is low but sufficiently diverse to my mind. Not a lot on WikiTalk but enough on Wiki itself. Particularly impressed by 1.19 average edits per page and the number of article edits relative to overall amount. Shows she gets things right and that she hits a diverse number of pages. Nice answers to questions. 
support,no qualms. 
support,Discussion edits are kinda low but adminship is no big deal right? 
support,[[WP:ESP|e]]
support,As nominator vote of support. 
support,where has the problem with talk namespace suddenly leapt from? That was certainly not a hoop I had to jump through when I became an admin... 
support,I see Shanel very active with her mop w/o injuring or leaving any wet liquid on the floor or any victim behind her. Applies WP rules gently! 
support,lack of experience with conflict doesn't mean she's not ready to be an admin she doesn't have to get involved in conflicts if not comfortable wtih them give her the tools to be a more effective editor which is what she wants to be 
oppose,Not much interaction in the talk spaces. Will support if you become more active in the community. 
oppose,Oppose insufficient interaction with the community for me to have confidence in her. It doesn't help that the nomination comes from a user whose behavior has been extremely erratic. I would reconsider if she was being endorsed by people I know and trust. 
oppose,Try again in a few months you need more experience in Talk and such. 
oppose,Not enough interaction with the community via talk pages. I need more proof that you can actually handle negotiation and mediation while maintaining [[WP:CIVIL]] at all times. 
oppose,Weak Oppose per ZZyzx11. I need more of a record to have confidence in this user. 
oppose,Needs more time experience and interaction with others on Wikipedia first. 
oppose,Sorry too soon. 
support,need more admins who take on the vandals.
support,A quick review of his contributions shows an intelligent articulate editor and a true encyclopedist. His interactions with others show an eventempered attitude (with rare exceptions as MONGO pointed out) and good understanding of consensus. I'd be happy to see more consistent edit summaries and an expansion beyond the topic of the [[:Category:Participants_in_the_September_11%2C_2001_attacks|19 hijackers]] but I have no problem trusting him with the Block button. It is also refreshing to see another editor eager to save articles on [[:CAT:CSD]].
support,As an editor Sherurcij has made intelligent interesting fairminded contributions. I am sure they will prove to be an intelligent fairminded admin. 
support,Seems to be a good editor and vandal fighter. 
support,Exchange between myself and on his <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Sherurcij#Tongue_in_cheek.2C_re:_your_Rfa talk page> tell me this editor is smart and patient with blunt questions and doesn't hide his true sentiments. Hence my vote change to support.
support,seems ok. 
support,seems unlikely to abuse administrator tools. 
support,We need admins with participation on wide range of subjects.
support,Yeah man! You're being opposed by all the right people. 
support,I like the idea of recat'ing the 'NPOV Disputes' category and adding templates. We are as I userstand it encouraged to [[WP:BOLD|Be Bold]]. I also don't see why one should oppose based on a couple (actually from here it looks like an iffy one) factual errors on one article. I would encourage you however to tone the rvv edit summaries down a little bit some of them are somewhat extreme (this is the only thing keeping me from voting Strong The merge thing to me as well sounds exactly as explained it. And I probably would have expected the [[2003 invasion of Iraq media coverage]] article to contain at least something about George Alexander to be considered a Merge. (at least in my mind that makes sense.) I probably would have also thought it vandalism following this comment: "Hahahahahaha impolite to him? He's dead! He didn't even do anything besides having those pretty zeros. SPUI (talk) 00:47 7 November 2005 (UTC)". I also applaud pointing out your failings and faults right there in the nom and the fact that you seem to have invited your detractors to your RfA ;> Anyhow Good luck I think you would make a fine admin! </big> [[User_Talk:Vilerage|Reply]]>[[Special:Contributions/Vilerage|C]][[Special:Emailuser/Vilerage|Spam Me!]]</strong>
support,Does some good work and is dedicated. Good admin material. 
oppose,for now but I want to be fair and I'll reconsider depending on Sherurcij's response. I had some problems editing with him at [[Shehzad Tanweer]] one of the 7/7 London suicide bombers. Sherurcij edited a number of mistakes into the article (factual spelling and grammar) and insisted that using an image of Tanweer about to board a train before blowing himself up was POV which was bizarre given that [[Scotland Yard]] had confirmed Tanweer was one of the bombers. Sherurcij also fiercely opposed saying in the intro how many had died overall in the bombing (56 dead 700 wounded) arguing that Tanweer should be associated only with the number he had actually killed (7) even though the police had confirmed the four bombers acted as part of a joint enteprise and that it was a matter of chance exactly how many each man had actually killed. (And in fact in his first preferred version he didn't even want the number of people Tanweer had killed directly to be mentioned until the very last paragraph. <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shehzad_Tanweer&diff=18995997&oldid=18993971>) He also uploaded a number of images without tagging and sourcing them and even though he was warned they'd be deleted and was asked to find the source (I offered to find the right tag if he would just tell me where he'd found them) he ignored the queries and the images were of course deleted then he didn't go back to delete the red links. All in all it was irresponsible editing in my view. See [[Talk:Shehzad_Tanweer#Reverting]] until the end of the page and here's his first revert of my edits <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Shehzad_Tanweer&diff=19038829&oldid=19037923> where he has a brief intro saying Tanweer is a suspect (even though the police had already confirmed) but with no details until the very end of the article and with odd writing like "his suspected death." However Sherurcij may have moved on since then so I suppose that's my question to you Sherurcij: have you? ;) 
oppose,Modest oppose. While I have not slogged through your differences over content SlimVirgin's comment on images led me to check yours: while tagging has improved since your arguments in July you are slipping too much fair use in here particularly from news organizations. While I'm willing to be corrected you can't just upload from Reuters and call it fair usetheir policy is quite clearly all rights reserved. This would normally lead me to neutral but weak edit summaries and a rather inadequate reply re. "shut the fuck up" lead me to oppose. 
oppose,Per Marskell and SV's points. 
oppose,concerned about actions at [[Shehzad Tanweer]] and responses regarding those actions and some concerns about images as well. 
oppose,per SlimVirgin's posts above and below. I applaud the stated "NPOVaddict" goal but am dismayed at the insulting/amusing edit summaries. 
oppose,Strong Oppose Today he removed POV tags from two articles <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Canadian_nationalism&diff=prev&oldid=28976029> <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2004_U.S._presidential_election_controversy_and_irregularities&diff=prev&oldid=28976039> marking his edits as minor and using the deceptive edit summary "updating template/cat".

oppose,at least this time around per Slim and Carbonite... To quote from the RfA page Admins have no special authority on Wikipedia but are held to high standards as they are often perceived as the "official face" of Wikipedia. Admins should be courteous and should exercise good judgment and patience in dealing with others. Nominees should have been on Wikipedia long enough for people to see whether they have these qualities. I am one of those who holds selfnominations to a somewhat higher standard but in this case I would've had to have voted "oppose" even if it weren't a selfnom... [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
oppose,Recently for some odd reason Sherurcij actually came onto my user discussion page and "warned" me to "watch my step" because in his view I was being too "POV" in an article (see "...watch your step a bit..." at [[User talk:IZAK#Kadima]]). He must learn to tone down his attitude/s before being granted more "powers" whereby I can just see it he would run around and warn unsuspecting Wikipedians to "watch your step...or else..." This is not what Wikipedia needs right now. 
support,but I expect many to oppose based on no of edits:time spent here ratio... 
support,Contributes on various technical cleanup projects and dealt with a minor edit conflict appropriately. 
support,unlikely to abuse admin tools. 
support,Sounds like this editor will put the tools to good use. With nearly 2000 edits and a year on Wikipedia I think Simetrical has shown that he is unlikely to misuse the tools. 
support,Clear support. [[Image:Flag_of_Europe_and_Austria.svg|20px]] 
support,Seems mature and levelheaded willing and able to communicate when required and unlikely to abuse the admin tools. 
support,admin is no bg deal so no problem supporting.
support,the low edits don't bother me as I see a potential long term commitment anyway.
support,After a deeper look at this user's contributions I think the postive edits outweigh the lower edit count. 
support,good editor 
support,Good edits. Good editor. 
support,Strongly support. An honorable editor with integrity who respects policy and the restraint of power. 
support,[[Wikipedia:Esperanza|ε]]
oppose,too new not enough contribs not ready. Come back later. 
oppose,<http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3ACategories_for_deletion&diff=31419741&oldid=30874035 Thinks deletion debates are votes>. 
oppose,insufficient grasp of policy. User has potential but needs some more experience. 
oppose,making up policy as he goes along claiming that Wikipedia has no policy forbidding the creation of articles about nonnotable people despite the [[WP:CSD]] official policy. 
oppose,per Zoe. Based on his AfD votes I do not feel Simetrical has a sufficient grasp of article deletion and inclusion policies and do not at this point feel comfortable with his ability to make impartial judgements on consensus if given the power to close AfD discussions. I don't expect administrators to agree with all current policies but I do expect them to respect the policies and I'm not sure if the candidate in question does. 
oppose,per comments below. A little too radical for an admin in 2005; could use more experience with the consensus model too. 
oppose,per reasonings above and some comments below. Notability requirements should not be too exclusive but to keep Wikipedia from becoming a personal webhost and spam/advertisement/linkfarm we need notability and inclusion criteria. The fact they're sometimes used to restrictively doesn't change that. 
oppose,per Zoe and FCYTravis. Needs more understanding of how policies are applied before implementing them. 
oppose,per Zoe. To paraphrase Mr. Parham I fear this user is likely to abuse admin tools if he gets them at present. 
support,I've been impressed with his edits and commitment to janitorial tasks. 
support,Has been here over a year and has nearly 4500 edits. As I've often come across this user having fixed typos and redirects (sometimes beating me to it while googling for particular typos curses!) and never engaged in an edit war I'd judge his selfdescription as a [[Wikipedia:WikiGnome|gnome]] is fairly apt. 
support,What personal attacks? Few isolated angry comments are not enough reason to oppose. My impression so far is that his good contributions outweight the few questionable ones by wide margin. 
support,lots of good work. i'm not terribly worried about two pretty minor incidents of crankiness. but i do worry about losing the contributions a hardworking editor like this could make as sysadmin. 
oppose,A cursory look at his contributions indicates insults and personal attacks including <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Jim_Taricani&diff=9983025&oldid=9982977 this> (for which he was warned and later apologized) and <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requested_moves&diff=prev&oldid=9645052 this> (which he was nice enough to point out was an insult). 
oppose,Attitude problem. 
oppose,Cryptoderk's links show me this user has an attitude problem. I don't want to risk the next 'angry comment' being followed by an illicit block. Therefore oppose (for now at least). 
oppose,There are rarely instances where such anger (again looking at Cryptoderk's links) or insults are needed. Take some time to calm down and try again later. 
oppose,Crypto's links leave me wondering if you'd be able to effectively handle a dispute calmly when you have admin tools at your disposal. 
oppose,Take the proverbial chill pill. 
support,Looks to be a very good user who would make great use of admin tools. 
support,Wha..? of course. 
support,His wording above was unfortunate but looking through his contribs I see no reason why he cannot be trusted with admin priviliges. Remember adminship is "no big deal". 
support,Granted his contributions are good. In the future I'd advise him to reread important things before posting them so that misunderstandings like this one don't happen. [[Image:Flag_of_Europe_and_Austria.svg|20px]] 
support,given his contributions and answers below. 
support,am happy with this editor's contributions clean ups are good. 
support,see no problems here. 
oppose,Three months is quite short. Also your comments "I would like the tools to wipe Wikipedia clean of articles and media that do not meet the standards" is a bit worrying. Many articles do not make the standard because they are badly written and need a clean up rather than deletion. 
oppose,lack of experience with policy and process. 
oppose,based on comments made in selfnom. We need admin that make bridges not one that burns them. 
oppose,Even taking into account the revised statement the poor choice of words in the original is a sign that more experience is needed. If an admin said that in closing an AfD debate it would cause unfortunate distress for many. I'll be glad to support in three months. 
oppose,This guy's approach to improving Wikipedia seems to rely too heavily on the "delete" button that he's trying to get. In addition to his deletionist comments above <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=UN_Security_Council_Resolution_1564&diff=prev&oldid=26888503 here> is an example of him attempting to speedy an article that clearly doesn't qualify under CSD (and eventually was cleaned up nicely) and <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Ljubob&diff=prev&oldid=31474450 here> he is marking a User page for speedy deletion (carelessly if not deliberately). I'm also puzzled by his comment "...no to mention the "goodfaith" edits by new users." which tools is he after for dealing with those good faith edits? His comment regarding "the huge number of almost ancient vfddiscussions that are still awaiting their closure" is strange; we have eliminated the backlog on AfD; the oldest one currently open is from 8 days ago not "the first half of 2004". We don't need a triggerhappy deletionist to "wipe Wikipedia clean" "deal with" new users and block the authors of articles that meet CSD as he promises to do in his first answer. I'd rather go with a candidate who wants to save articles and guide new users. 
oppose,The thing about VfDs from early 2004 is weird. They just haven't been templated is all and the debates were usually just copied to talk pages and [[Wikipedia:Archived delete debates|deletion log archives]]. First draft of answer and redraft both indicate a need to swim around rather more yet and establish proper familiarity with common processes before offering promises about them. 
oppose,strong Oppose user accepted his own selfnom clearly inexperienced. 
oppose,User sounds controversial in the selfnom reasons. 
oppose,per above. User seems a little too controversial to be granted adminship this soon. Next time be a little humbler when introducing yourself and dealing with other users. 
support,Strong May need some coaching but a definate good faith user who has excellent admin potential. Who amongst us (myself included) can hope to be the one without sin who casts the first stone? 
support,Strong Active friendly factual articulate and honest Wikipedian. I feel that it is in the best interests of our community that we get more helpful admins onboard like this young addict. 
support,More levelheaded than a lot of Wikipedians I've interacted with but still just a human like the rest of us. . 
support,He has been here awhile and made many sound contibutions however edit summary use could be better.[[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,Another fine editor from the land of the Moose. 
support,for all the reasons given above. 
support,You spin me round and round like a record baby support. 
support,go4it
support,I see him during RC patrol and he does good work. My concerns below have been addressed by him so I think he could do a good job w/ the mop. 
support,worked with him before and I think he is a fine user the links below do not change my mind a bit. 
support,[[WP:ESP|e]]
support,although I think Spinboy could improve aspects of his editing and community interaction per many of the oppose voters I feel he would employ admin tools responsibly. 
support,Spinboy has been very helpful to me and is the one who initially welcomed me. He'll make a great admin. 
oppose,I think although I'm reasonably willing to debate that. Doesn't quite have the temperament for it is my feeling. See the edit summaries <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hunt_Club_Road_%28Ottawa%29&diff=prev&oldid=26403950 here> and <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:University_of_Ottawa&diff=prev&oldid=26395525 here> for example. Those are among the very few times he uses edit summaries at all. I've noticed him principally on CfD where he seems to oppose even the simplest of renames without offering a reason at all (he's allowed to oppose of course but see for example [[Wikipedia:Categories for deletion/Log/2005 October 12#Category:Political parties in Canada|here]]: note that another user expresses what I just said because it is far from the first such oddity). Also has a habit of voting without reason in the deletion processes which is rarely appropriate and suggests he views such operations as pure votes rather than discussionswithpolls e.g. <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Los_Bastardos&diff=prev&oldid=24362755> <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Steve_Garfield&diff=prev&oldid=24215906> <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Dr._Daniel_Engels&diff=prev&oldid=24215886> <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion/Log/2005_October_15&diff=prev&oldid=25615780> <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Aberdeen_Street&diff=prev&oldid=24610656> and the stubborness in [[Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Ottawa municipal election 2006]] isn't great either (although there are users more stubborn by far). These are a pretty random result of a trawl through contribs to see if my gut instinct was borne out: they have to be random because it's impossible to tell from edit summaries what might be in the edit. 
oppose,Oppose. Dedicated worker but far too volatile. You're supposed to keep to the civility policy [[Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Tony_Sidaway_2#Outside_view_by_Spinboy|even if you don't feel like it]]. God knows it's hard to deal with people you consider destructive idiots as if they aren't but it's pretty much a requirement of working on the wiki. (See also .) This particularly applies to someone wanting to be an admin. May calm down in the future; ask again in six months 
oppose,per Splash and Tony Sidaway. I've found other incidents of incivility as well. 
oppose,per Tony's excellent comments. 
oppose,This editor is excessively possessive of articles related to Ottawa. For example he <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image:Parkway1.jpg&diff=next&oldid=23768576 reverted> my <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Image%3AParkway1.jpg&diff=23768576&oldid=17489890 tagging> of a photo as "replaceable fair use" for no good reason and became <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AKelly_Martin&diff=23768750&oldid=23426992 argumentative> about it on my talk page afterwards. In addition I'm not comfortable supporting until I better understand what his role in the [[Freemasonry]] dispute is (see [[Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Lightbringer]]). In general not a good candidate for adminship. Finally I disapprove of images in signatures. 
oppose,I am not well acquainted with the gentleman in question but the comments brought up by Splash and Tony as well as a check of his edit history do cast his temperement in a rather poor light. Anyone who is not capable of garnering the respect of his peers should not be an admin in my opinion.
oppose,The links provided by users above show an unfortunate lack of civility. 
oppose,Reluctantly oppose. Spinboy has done a great deal for Wikipedia and his enthusiasm for improving it is remarkable and in good faith IMO but an administrator has to be trusted to use the mop to clean up spills not beat the person doing the spilling and I think at this point it would be a license to continue the behavior detailed above. (Replying to a question about intent below with an edit count is not encouraging either.) 
oppose,per Splash and Tony Sidaway. Also not convinced by the candidate's answers in "Questions for the candidate". 
oppose,reluctantly per Splash. I like Spinboy but I too have noticed too many AfD votes and edits without explanation. Admins need to have reasons for these things and need to be comfortable routinely expressing them. 
oppose,per civility problems as stated above. An admin cannot be uncivil. 
oppose,Strong Oppose <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:University_of_Ottawa&diff=prev&oldid=26395525>. 
oppose,for the reasons cited by Tony Sidaway. Needs time to work out issues of civility. 
oppose,For not being civil and for not using edit summaries nearly enough.
oppose,per Splash and Tony Sidaway maybe later not a big fan of this user espcially over some conflct in AFD lately over Toronto Roads 
oppose,spelt vandalism with a Z and has an image in their signature. AfD seems to have turned another potential admin bad. 
oppose,per above. 
oppose,per things above. 
support,Sure. 
oppose,I must oppose on the grounds that this user's activity on Wikipedia is far too sparse and I personally feel that administrators (at the very least new ones) should be very active (20+ edits a day 5+ days a week).oo64eva (Alex) (
oppose,IMHO this user does not yet have enough experience in the community. 
oppose,Only 642 contributions in 1 year is a very very low commitment here. Come back when you are more active. 
oppose,Will support at 1K edits. 
oppose,Must oppose at this time. I'm not sure how many edits is enough or even if there can be a hard and fast number but 642 contributions is not enough in my view. Keep working though; may support in future. 
oppose,642 edits in a year works out to less than two a day. A reasonable enough count for an editor sure but this doesn't seem to be an editor in desperate need of the admin tools at the moment. Give it more time though and I'll support. 
oppose,1.7589041095890410958904109589041 edits a day? No. 
oppose,Good editor but does not have the commitment to either this project or to adminship that I expect from a proposed admin. 
oppose,No problems with editorial behaviour but with such a low level of activity and no sign of any interest in the extra tools this nomination seems premature. 
oppose,With close to 900 edits under my belt I still feel like a newbie and wouldn't even consider going for admin at this stage. I also amassed those edits in about a month so I don't think Spottedowl has put much effort in.
support,I've seen his work all over the site and wonder why he isn't an admin already. However I would like him to explain how as he states on his user page he "elevat(ed) His Imperial Majesty [[Haile Selassie I of Ethiopia]] to the status of [[Almighty God]]" without violating NPOV. 
support,Solid work especially in fighting vandalism. 
support,More than qualified. 
oppose,Reluctantly oppose. Squeakbox has been involved in a couple nasty conflicts with POV pushing users. There's nothing inherently wrong with that but his approach to these conflicts has caused them to escalate. For example he posted notes on Cumbey's blog escalating his dispute with that user. Squeakbox sometimes brings animosity upon himself such as a couple weeks ago when he said to another user "Fuck off Nazi scum" <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Zapatancas&diff=18900583&oldid=18820093>. Granted he removed his personal attack within minutes but the user found it in the page's history and continues to harass SqueakBox about it. You've done great work on articles but I think you need a thicker skin to be an administrator. 
oppose,Unfortunately oppose for his overzealous attempt to delete [[AfroLatin American]] and [[AfroMexican]] articles and his attempts to block any edits to improve these articles when they were on VfD. Also his handling of conflict at the [[Talk:José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]] ("Stop talking bullshit" and comments about "leftwingers" <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Jos%C3%A9_Luis_Rodr%C3%ADguez_Zapatero&diff=prev&oldid=19653716>). Like Rhobite it's mostly about the thicker skin he's a hardworking fellow though I admit it and has good intentions. 
oppose,per rhobite and vizcarra 
oppose,Must oppose given his unfortunate behavior re [[Rastafarianism]] and elsewhere. Pushes his own POV in the name of NPOV and gets downright childish when he doesn't get his way. 
oppose,User appears to believe writing "fuck off you Nazi troll" can be described as "mild in comparison". I am not confortable with the way [[Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents#User:Zapatancas_and_User:SqueakBox|this incident]] was handled. 
oppose,Strong oppose. Absolutely not. Has an agenda came to <http://www.batpedia.com Batpedia> and tried to set up Haile Selassie and Javier Solana as gods (see <http://www.batpedia.com/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&target=SqueakBox contribs>). Admittedly that encyclopedia is full of bullshit (it's a Wikipedia parody of sorts) but he apparently thought it to be serious and said at one point "The article is too pro Solana to be legitimately at Wikipedia. I used the basic frame (which I had put a lot of input into over there) but frustrated at not being able to express my own point of view at wikipedia I rewrote it." 
oppose,<del>. After reading arguments on both sides and seeing examples of racism in some edits i must say no.</del> Removed due to my misunderstanding of the circumstances. 
oppose,I was supporting him initially but after seeing his notquite[[Wikipedia:Civility|civil]] and definitely not [[WP:NPOV|NPOV]] replies to the oppose votes ("it is not a serious wiki. It is a gay porn site run by Fundamentalist Christian animeobsessed crackaddicted termitefarming leprechauns who are physically incapable of telling a lie.") and the arguments presented in those votes I will now switch my vote to oppose. 
support,You have been active in many different parts of Wikipedia and seem to have a good understanding of its policies. I was looking at some of the comments you left on user pages and they seem levelheaded enough. However I think that your nomination would be stronger if you had a specific conflict to talk about; it would've given me a more specific idea of how you act diplomatically. Also I hope that not being an admin hasn't kept you from "help<ing> out more seriously" around here! 
support,I have to stress though that the points raised by below are valid and important to me too. [[Image:Flag of Austria.svg|15px]] 
oppose,for now. I could be convinced otherwise by stories from others of working out problems with a reasonable and calm attitude but my own limited experience with this editor has been fairly testy (for example he reverted a change I made to the content of an article with "rvv" in the edit summary despite the fact that I had left the rationale behind what I was doing in my edit summary <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tecumseh%27s_curse&diff=27008649&oldid=26441843>). That actually was one of the few edit summaries he left on an article I was looking at — most of them appear to have no edit summary at all something particularly important when you're making changes that other people might disagree with. So my personal experience combined with the comments of below the limited answers to the questions and relatively short Wikipedia history compel me to oppose.
oppose,Yes I have no doubts that Stax is a wellintentioned user but the points raised by and show me that Stax is a little too new or unfamiliar with Wikipedia policies to be a good admin right now. A quick glance of contributions also shows an underuse of edit summaries. I'm sure you'll make a great administrator if you take the comments and concerns raised in this RFA. [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
oppose,Per Cleared as filed. Someone who can't tell the difference between vandalism and a content dispute should not have a rollback button. 
oppose,per Cleared as filed. 
oppose,Exactly the same thing as Cleared as filed happened to me with this editor. He reverted my revert of someone who was making unexplained removals in an article by saying "rvv". Better understanding before reverting is needed. Otherwise please keep reverting vandalism if you see it and good work. 
oppose,per Cleared as Filed. Questionable reversion history prevents awarding of rollback button at this time. Learn from the above criticisms and I will be happy to support reapplication in several months. 
oppose,for now per the above. └
support,of course as nominator! 
support,a friend of Y0u is a friend of mine 
support,Friendly users on RC patrol are great to have as admins. Regarding Splash's concern in the oppose section... I once thought the same way ([[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Khaosworks]]) but I have come to appreciate that goodfaith contributors will be cautious about using their powers in areas they have little experience. Limited experience on VFD might even be a sign of sanity... 
support,I've reviewed some of Stevey7788's recent edits and he seems to be careful and focused qualities which I'd like to see in an administrator. 
support,Careful support user is a good editor but needs to relax as far as how SPUI points out. I don't like cuss words either but it's impossible to remove them from an allinclusive project. 
support,Seems to make lots of valuable edits. I don't believe that any lack of familiarity really matters at the end of the day so long as the user is acting in goodfaith. Also the fact that he gets offended by offensive user pages is probably a good sign. 
support,Based on Stevey7788's responses here I am moving my vote from neutral to support. His polite responses willingness to admit mistakes and ability to modify his actions are all important qualities for an administrator. I hope he now understands the importance of discussion and of seeking feedback for controversial actions. 
support,I think the opposers' concerns are totally off the mark. 
support,Demonstrated good commitment to the Wikipedia project and has made good article content contributions. I would like to see more deletion related activity (e.g. VfD/TfD) however when this user receives administrative privileges and I would also like the user to bear in mind the issue over objectionable user page content in the future. However I am confident that this user would use administrative privileges well and seems like an affable and reasonable individual; I thus have no qualms about offering my support. 
support,Stevey's right gratuitous offensive material is unnecessary. His method of addressing the situation was misguided but he has apologized which is good enough for me. 
oppose,too little experience of adminrelated things. In amongst a healthy editcount and good article work there is next to no participation in VfD/TfD/CfD etc (though appeared on VfD a little while ago today) and I see only a little evidence of RC/NP patrol in the last 1000 edits (judged from edit summaries). The bulk of the Wikipedia: space edits are either to the sandbox or to things related to the sandbox. The talk page edits are a mixture of template welcomes and interaction: the interaction appears to be uniformly pleasant which is good. I think that given the user's slight reluctance and current inexperience in the spikier areas of WP a month or two trying out some new things would be healthy. 
oppose,removes <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ASPUI&diff=18621025&oldid=18609597 "offensive content" consisting of text from user pages> and <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Fonzie_Fann&diff=prev&oldid=18621400 the word "fuck" from messages when not used as a personal attack>. 
oppose,for the reasons above. 
oppose,per . The Wikipedia doesn't need pseudomoralists thank you very much I do not agree with the user's line of thought. 
oppose,users should edit for a lot longer before applying for administratorship. A simple editcount is not a good evaluation of a user's sincerity towards the Wikimedia...users should be "timetested". 
oppose,to short a time not enough involvement. Unenthused by the accusations of attempted censorship.
oppose,reluctantly. Wikipedia is not censored. &middot; 
oppose,As per above. Maybe next time. 
oppose,death to censorship. 
support,I do not find the reasons given for opposing convincing. 
support,Nor do I. 
support,I'm willing to support too. 
support,Looks like a fine user. That signature issue seems to have been a long time ago. 
oppose,No way. 
oppose,I can't support someone who's <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Supercentenarian&diff=prev&oldid=10651112 used their sig for panicmongering> for admin. 
oppose,per Carnildo 
oppose,I too dislike the panicmongering 
oppose,suspicious about his POV orientation based on past interaction. 
oppose,per IZAK and Carnildo. 
oppose,I have serious concerns about the possible uses of this power if given and I agree that stub sorting doesn't really show a need for the extra capabilities unlike say vfd quick deletions or other functions that are greatly helped by having the increased functional abilities though since administration is no big deal I would have no problem supporting your RFA in the future if you have shown that you would benefit from acess to the increased responsibilities of administratorship. 
oppose,for many of the same reasons above. 
oppose,based on panicmongering. The sysop who did this in the past deserves to be desysopped; someone who tends to it already certainly should not be made one in the first place. 
oppose,Most edits don't have an [[edit summary]]. 
oppose,Wow. Almost 1000 edits to his user page...in a little over a month...out of over 4000 edits total. I've been here almost two years and I haven't topped 500 edits on my user page. Sorry just not enough experience. 
oppose,Agree with RadicalBender. Also needs to learn to use the preview button more often. 
oppose,Not yet. Glad to have you on Wikipedia but I don't think you're ready to be an administrator. I think the questions should have been answered already for a selfnomination. Also use of the {{tl|vprotected}} tag on your user page is not appropriate; this should not be placed on unprotected pages. You have a very high edit count but it seems it takes many edits to accomplish one thing such as the seven edits to [[WP:RFA]] to place this nomination. Increased use of the "preview" function would be helpful I feel. Try to become a little more familiar with Wikipedia policy if you would like to become an administrator. Other than that keep up your good work. 
oppose,Nope. Probably an okay user but the questions have not been answered not enough use of the preview button and the incorrect use of the protected template all bother me. Also while I like your enthusiasm on the sport of Wrestling I feel you're too focused on this one area; also I'm not a fan of how most of your articles are short stubs that don't really assert notability. I might support in a later nomination but not now. 
oppose,Even though I have had a good experience with SWD316 I do not feel that he is experienced enough to be an admin. He also inflates his number of edits by saving without previewing.May the Force be with you! 
oppose,No. Lacks edit summaries. Hasn't even accepted own nomination or answered the questions yet. Plus has only been here for five weeks. 
oppose,not experienced enough 
oppose,Will support in 12 months. 
oppose,membership in [[Wikipedia:WikiProject_Wikipedians_for_Decency|Wikipedians for Decency]] causes some concern as I'm not sure that group is fully aligned with Wikipedia principles and policies. 
support,Extreme "Ha! I beat the nominator" support always been impressed (though I can't think of anything in particular I've worked with him on). Plus it's the nominator's birthday today! [[user:Celestianpower|Cel]][[WP:ESP|e]]
support,Strong "Duh" support Curses I forgot to vote. My reasons for supporting are at the top of this page.
support,good user active vandalwhacker. 
support,second time is charm for me.
support,unlikely to abuse administrator tools. 
support,<font>&laquo;
support,edits look fine and seen you around and you do good work.
support,He's gained a lot more experience with Wikipedia since his first RfA. Although his edits are concetrated in one area his conduct and knowlege about the Wikipedia community makes up for it. 
support,Very strong support I'd have nominated him myself but someone beat me to it! 
support,Looking good.
support,This'll do this'll do just fine... 
oppose,Strong Oppose Doesn't have a single mainspace edit outside of professional wrestling articles. Once edited my user page without asking. Accused me of being a sockpuppet vandal (which is false). Even made remarks that I was a "poor editor" which I feel violates various Wikipedia conduct rules. He has an inflated edit count as he has about 2000 edits on his user page alone. Even has elements of his user page mispelled and sloppily done despite the massive amount of edits on his userpage ("Vandalizing againts"?). He comes off as unprofessional and immature. I feel that he may abuse his proposed moderator powers and that he does not handle his stress well on the site. Maybe he has done some good but look at the facts before you make your decision. 
oppose,He needs a bit more experience. 
oppose,a litle too controversial for this time should spell check his user page it left a poor impression on me. 
oppose,Inconsistent use of edit summaries (although this has improved lately). Very few edits in Wikipedia namespace outside of the [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|Esperanza]] or [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Professional wrestling|wrestling WikiProject]] pages. I'm not convinced you have any working knowledge of policies. A quick glance through your contributions reveals a lack of any experience of reverting vandalism or reporting copyvios and a continuing neglection of the preview button. I'd like to see edits among a wider variety of topics or working with categories or any of the administratortype work you'll be asked to do (requested moves CfD TfD etc.). 
oppose,Vast majority of edits are talk pages or wrestling pages. His comments here aren't encouraging. 
oppose,I agree with Howcheng. Hardly ever fights vandalism. The arguments and aggressive tone with mcfly isn't helping either. 
oppose,Inconsistent no mainstream articles really outside wrestling. Remarks here seem to indicate inflamatory style does not bode well for potential admin.
support,Permanent strong support Trustable and if sockpuppetry is used in his RfA and he's denied I'll support him on his next RfA. 
support,I trust you to be a responsible admin. 
support,he deserves it. 
support,yes I agree would be great admin.
support,absolutely and the info about McFly appears to be correct <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard#Mcfly85>
support,In spite of annoying pastel box and tons of pointless user boxes on user page this use deserves my support. 
support,as before brill user! [[user:Celestianpower|Cel]][[WP:ESP|e]]
support,Admin material; chances should not be ruined thanks to sockpuppetry. 
support,(s)he deserves it. He should control his temper a bit more at times though. [[Image:Flag_of_Europe_and_Austria.svg|20px]] 
support,I supported the first one still do. Some of you may have noticed that I have consistently opposed RfA renomination unless 23 months have passed but I feel like in this case the first one was not given a fair shot 
support,Strong 
support,He does deserve it.
support,Yet again.
support,Another bipolar admin? I guess since I'm gone somebody has to take my place! 
support,Need I say why? Same reasons as last time.

support,trying to counterbalance somewhat the opposition over SWD316's "I quit" <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ASWD316&diff=31426974&oldid=31301335 tirade>. It is a tirade but all it shows about SWD316 is that he's human. McFly's unscrupulous sockpuppet attack on SWD316's RFA:2 is about the worst I've seen on this page and I'm sorry SWD didn't get more support from the community including myself. :( 
support,[[Wikipedia:Esperanza|ε]]
support,Still a strong 
support,Need more admins. [[User_talk:Brian0918|0918]]
oppose,Woah your nomination was withdrawn yesterday. Dont you think that just one day is enough time between adminship requests? Oppose also per censoring McFly's user page regardless of him being a vandal/troll/sock whatever he's called. 
oppose,Inconsistent use of edit summaries (although this has improved lately). Very few edits in Wikipedia namespace outside of the [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|Esperanza]] or [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Professional wrestling|wrestling WikiProject]] pages. I'm not convinced he has any working knowledge of policies. A quick glance through his contributions reveals a dearth of any experience of reporting copyvios working with AfD/CfD/TfD and a continuing neglection of the preview button. Furthermore <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:SWD316&oldid=31426974 his response> to the sockpuppetinfested previous nomination demonstrates a lack of levelheadedness that an administrator should have. At this point in time I'm worried he'll fly off the handle and block someone undeservedly or unilaterally delete something he disagrees with. 
oppose,per the thorough vote of howcheng. The corruption of the previous vote is unfortunate but this user needs more experience and would have been better advised to have delayed this renomination. (I realize he didn't selfnom but it might have been wise to have declined Nlu's generous offer.) 
oppose,strong Oppose <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ASWD316&diff=31426974&oldid=31301335 no way>. 
oppose,I was not influenced by the sockpuppets' votes in the beginning. My voting was due to SWD316's lack of edit summaries and lack of vandalism fighting. His claim that he was "rolling back vandalism" when I "typed in that SWD316 never roll back any vandalism" is false after checking his contributions page. He never rolled back vandalism while I was adding in my oppose vote. I am stupid enough to listen to sockpuppets? No I am not and I am not screwups either. 
oppose,due to the inappropriate and seemingly immature tirade cited by and . 
oppose,"Gay little sockpuppets"? Wikipedia admins should be more grownup than this. 
oppose,Strong Oppose This user has demonstrated a total lack of maturity and stability to be an admin. 
oppose,per above. 
oppose,per above. Would reconsider in a few months. 
oppose,His immature homophobic overthetop response three days ago is the opposite of what we need to see from an admin. Sockpuppetry is an everyday fact of life here and if you don't know how to deal with that in a mature eventempered way adminship is likely not for you. 
oppose,His withdrawal message is far too impulsive and immature. Using "gay" as an insult is step toward being on RfC not RfA. [[User talk:Rspeer|r</span]]>
oppose,per 's <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ASWD316&diff=31426974&oldid=31301335 link provided above.> 
oppose,per 's <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User%3ASWD316&diff=31426974&oldid=31301335 evidence of immaturity and lack of civility>.
oppose,per 's evidence. Although I haven't had much contact with SWD316 his reaction to his previous RfA showed him to be quite volatile as an editor and possibly prone to abusing admin tools. While I'm a firm believer in no double jeopardy and would be willing to reconsider in several months this edit was only 3 days ago much too recent. 
oppose,Oppose. Administrators need to be models for the Wikipedia community. Using hobophobic terms in discussion no matter what the context is simply unacceptable for an admin. Not to say that we shouldn't forgive I definitely made some mistakes when I first started out but a few days is just too short for me to forget. I fully support redoing the VfD though. 
oppose,per 's evidence and 's statement. Admins need to be able to handle adversity and stress and I do not feel you can do that well enough to entrust blocking powers with.
oppose,User takes adminship too seriously 
oppose,Strongly oppose. Using "gay" as a putdown is really annoying and offensive. 
oppose,I've decided to change my vote to oppose based on Freestylefrappe's evidence and CDTheime's comment above Using "gay" as a putdown is typical and saying sorry does not make up for it. This user seems to keep making up excuses and reasons for what he has done in the past. 
oppose,Not fit to be an admin for the aforementioned reasons. 
oppose,because adminship shoudl be "no big deal". This user took it all too personally resulting in his infamous outburst. I urge you to think of the good things you can do on wikipedia without the need for admin tools. They're just a bunch of tools that make some things simpler after all. | [[User talk:Asbestos|<FONT COLOR="#808080">Talk </FONT]]>

support,No issue here put Ta bu shi da ya back on the list. 
support,obviously. Glad to have you back! 
support,Adminship should be no big deal. Regranting adminship to someone who was manifestly worth it even less so. I think TBDSY can be excused for thinking he left Wikipedia for good and if he did think that the deadminning is only sensible.

support,Duh. 
support,Speedy 
support,Great contributor! 
support,Strong oppose. 22:53 18 May 2005 (UTC) Rationale: generally unfriendly in my experience. It is also difficult to support someone for adminship when he has a previous history of admin abuse and I would definitely consider spamming user talk pages being blocked then unblocking oneself a history of admin abuse. Finally this user is about 30% of the reason why I asked for removal of adminship. 
support,And thar blows my vote record too I bet. Oh no! Does this mean I'm gonna have to pass on the honor of the <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bishonen&diff=13791772&oldid=13791332 Pufferfish> of Most Conceited New Admin to Ta Bu Shi?? :(

support,It's a redundant move by me to add my supporting vote now but may I just say that I will certainly look to TBSDY as one of my first admin contact points. Articulte balanced fair...this is what we need in all our admins all the time. Congrats on your soonTBC adminship Version 2. 
support,No question. Welcome back Ta bu. 
support,though a little concerned about recent edits to [[Daleks]]. 
support,a pleasure. 
support,I am sheep sung to the song [[I am cow]]. 
support,Don't be silly ta bu. A blanking of an article that remained for 3 minutes is not something to get worked up over. A lot of other users (including current admins) do things that are far more disruptive to Wikipedia like revert wars on popular articles. As for everyking ignore him. His latest disruption tactic is to oppose for no foreseeable reason on RfAs. You should be flattered he hasn't opposed your RfA he must really like you. 
support,of course. And cheer up about the Dalek thing. 
oppose,No way we're going to keep "the good stuff" out of your hands until you've well and truely kicked the habit! ;) 
oppose,His rabid inclusionism frightens me 
oppose,His prior record speaks for itself. Welcome back! |[[User talk:Tony Sidaway|Talk]] 14:58 21 May 2005 (UTC) Switch to oppose until there is an explanation of today's article vandalism on [[Dalek]]. I cannot be confident that this is the same editor who was formerly an administrator. 
oppose,I personally don't like his attitude. Good deeds aside it smacks of arrogance and it has consistently rubbed me the wrong way. I feel like I'm pretty much the only person on this earth who feels that way but that's my vote. 
oppose,until we get a good explanation of the recent vandalism. 21:00 23 May 2005 (UTC) in a month or so assuming TBSDY doesn't do anything else that spectacularly idiotic in the mean time. 
oppose,without a shaddow of a doubt. 11:55 18 May 2005 (UTC). Until an explanation is forthcomming regarding the apparent vandalism. 21:39 23 May 2005 (UTC). I've read the explanation now and while we do all need a bit of light releif now and again this wasn't the way to do it. Having said that when he was an admin before he did a lot of goog work and he wouldn't have been deadmined (I don't think) just for that. On balance I feel the fairest vote is oppose for now. When he's firmly back in the swing of things and has gotten this sort of joke out of his system then I'll probably vote support if he's nominated again. 
oppose,as per other users. I don't know why TBSDY would vandalize [[Dalek]] esp. when it was a featured article. "Showing people how it works" could be conducted in the sandbox which he was surely aware of. 
oppose,I supported but now i OPPOSE. Because of recent actions by the nominee. I recommend that all people who voted to support look into Ta bu shi da yu's [[Dalek]] stunt. 00:50 24 May 2005 (UTC) P.S. For those who do not know he <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dalek&diff=14094757&oldid=14094669 intentionally blanked an article> it was a feature article and it was a feature article being featured on the main page. He followed it with <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Dalek&diff=next&oldid=14094757 this edit>. This is behavior beneath my expectations of an admin candidate. 
support,His disambigs and the contributions he have made are all very good.
oppose,till user specifies an email id. 
oppose,until user actually completes the nomination. 
oppose,will rethink when he's told me why I should support. 
oppose,Edit summary usage only 31%. Averages just 2 edits per day (6.7 for contributing days). Distribution of edits is promising but the overall experience level is I think too low for adminship at this time. I also like to see self nominators follow instructions and examples in putting forth their nomination as it shows an ability to follow directions and thus policy; this was not done in this case. 
oppose,Sorry. At the very least you should fill out all the questions below including why you want to be an admin and what you intend to use these admin tools for that you can't do right now (and want to). Also at only <http://kohl.wikimedia.org/~kate/cgibin/count_edits?user=tdxiang&dbname=enwiki ~260 edits> I think you are much too inexperienced to be an admin. After some more experience you may get more support. 
oppose,Lack of [[edit summary|edit summaries]]. 
oppose,Too few edits. 
oppose,promising editor but too few edits. Please try again when you have atleast 1000 edits (atleast 10% of which should be in the Wikipedia namespace). I guarantee that you will have widespread support then! also here are a few good links: [[Recent Changes]] [[New pages]] and [[AFD]]. You could also participate in community discussions on a regular basis and vote here. </sup/><p style="fontfamily: Bradley Hand ITC Comic Sans MS;">
oppose,Too little experience. Questions not answered. BTW how do you guys know his percentage of edits without summary? 
oppose,Consistent disregard for form. Ignored the questions rarely bothers with edit summariesnot the type we want as admin. Doesn't need it either according to his description. 
oppose,Taking pictures of yourself is not someothing you need admin powers for. Neither is being the "Disambiguation" guy. 
oppose,Less than two months of activity is far too short a commitment to Wikipedia for you to become an administrator. Also your edit count is pretty low with too little talk and Project space edits. I would consider supporting in another 35 months.
oppose,Well for one you can start telling who you are! With such a short track record a bit more elaboration on the questions below and why you are especially qualified to become an admin would be nice despite your lack of commitment. 
oppose,It's you. We know that. Can we know more? Also 650 edits is far too little although I'm trying to stay away from editcountitis. 
oppose,Selfnomination too brief almost flippant. Normally I'm not an edit hound but in the context of that nomination 650 is too low. This will still be an oppose if nomination is expanded as the first posted brief content showed poor judgment on nominee's part. 
oppose,too little time on Wikipedia. Try again in a month or two. 
oppose,Vanity delete... oops wrong page. out of touch with the community. 
oppose,Too new and 650 too low 
oppose,Kindly oppose; user is on a good road but some more contribs and community involvement is needed. 
oppose,Sorry Tedernst. One suggestion would be to get reaquainted to Wikipedia (I see you've been registered since 2002) and learn how the process works. "It's me what can I say?" is quite frankly a turnoff for voters and seeing that this is a selfnom you need to be extracautious towards making the right impression. 
oppose,the shortness of the answers coupled with the shortness of time actually editing are not a good combination. However in a couple of months I would be willing to reappraise. I notice that you were able to merge [[Buiteraptor]]. Good one. Thanks. 
oppose,Your nomination description show that your are not quite ready for it. If you really want to became an administrator here are a few good tips you could follow: Try contributing more; spend more time on Wikipedia writing articles ad interacting with others; you will get experience. Also here are a few good links: Vote here on a regular basis. Others are more inclined to vote for you when they see that you parttake in the process of adminship. Secondly vote on [[AFD]]s ect; show others that you have an intimate understanding of Wikipolicies. Try contributing to [[Recent Changes]]revert vandalism warn editors using the {{tl|test}} {{tl|test2}}/{{tl|test2a}} {{tl|test3}} and {{tl|test4}} as appropriate and welcome others using {{tl|welcome}}. you could also go on [[Special:Newpages|newpages]] patrol and tag speedy deletions ect. Make sure that you interact a lot on AFds and RFA talk user talk etc. By doing all these others will see that you are working hard they will trust you and you will be successful; when you return in 12 months you will be a shoo in. PS:And next time if you are nominating yourself show that you want the extra tools and responsibilities. Put thoughts into the questions 
support,09:09 1 December 2005 (UTC). I see no reason to hinder your desire to help with the janitorial work here. 
support,Yeah support. It was mainly length of time here that foiled the last bid. Tedernst is still keen and has shown dedication to the 'pedia so go for it.

support,no big deal...I'm not inclined to think you'll vapor lock and turn into a lousy contributor in another month and see no reason to discourage you from continuing to be a good contributor by making you run for a third nomination.
support,[[Wikipedia:Esperanza|ε]]
support,unlikely to abuse administrator tools reasons presented for opposition to date are not compelling. 
support,these oppose votes are stupid and do not have a legitimate rationale. 
support,per Mongo. Why get in the way of someone who wants to fight vandals more efficiently?
support,Has been staying cool under provocation. 
support,Go forth and block some vandals. 
oppose,I don't think any RfA should be reconsidered in less that 23 months. 
oppose,Its been barely over a month too soon especially for a self nom and you seem over eager for admin status. Plus you have yet to reach the 3 month mark. Also while you have a high edit count over 4000 i dont really see any one edit with real content adding. While im saying that dab and link repairing arent bad they are not enough in my opinion to become an admin. Your on the right track maybe have someone else nom and I will support then. 
oppose,I must admit that Tedernst is a very good dismbig link fixer and gives always an edit summary. Still after going through the edits made between the nominations I noted that: 1) last 3 Afd votes were made on 10 November 5 November 4 November 2) ~94 % of edits between nominations are on Stubsorting tags dabs fixing link order tags all minor edits and lastly 3) during the month November 39 reverts ~1/day (rough count of rvv and revert Edit summaries) were made. Although a huge jump in edits has been made between the selfnominations (650 4000) most of the edits have been minor and little participation to AfD NA or RC can be noted from his editing pattern. So I wouldn't say that he "dabbled in different areas of Wikipedia" between the nominations. Also I support the opinions of and [[Special:Emailuser/Jobe6|e]]. 
oppose,per feydey. 
oppose,only because last nomination was just over a month ago per RogerD. March '06 will bring my support if that is even necessary. 
oppose,Too soon. 
oppose,Sadly oppose. If this RfA had come at a slightly later date perhaps after the start of the new year I would gladly give an accept vote. However after doing my research and looking at things I have to cast my vote as it is. Give yourself some time do some more work and come back in March or April I'll probably change my vote then! 
oppose,as being too soon (both in total time and since last RfA) and the concerns of Jobe6 above. 
oppose,<del>. We don't need more admins. Most abusive users are blocked quickly and if they aren't admins are easily contacted. Most vandalism that slips through wouldn't have been caught if every user had the rollback button. 
support,Levelheaded? Check. Civil? Check. Editcountitis happening in oppose votes? Check. Heading in the right direction? Check. Can have (most) errors corrected? Check. No big deal? Check. I think I'll go out on a limb and support for now. Just do try and be more active. [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,Read the first thing Kate's edit counter says nowdays. Kate's rather dissapointed in the editcountitus around the wiki because of her counter and I don't blame her. A great guy is being opposed based on his edit count. [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,in order to oppose editcountitis. I wouldn't vote but I feel compelled to do so just to work against those who oppose based on edit counts. 
support,This land is our land. 
support,Not everybody needs 100 lessons to pass their driving test. 
oppose,User has only 816 edits since April 2004. Needs to participate more to understand the community and how it works. Should have minimum of 1500 to 2000 edits. 
oppose,You've only recently returned from a very long break dating back to late last year with only a handful of edits during the interim. Your activity level has heavily spiked since your return which is good. A quick review of user interactions seems to show levelheadedness which is very important. I think you're headed in the right direction but keep it up for another 2 months and I think you'll be ready. Also please keep improving your use of edit summaries. For now I oppose. 
oppose,per Durin. Less than 1000 edits and a long break from the project. I agree with Durin that you seem to have the right idea. Do keep contributing build more experience check out what's happened with the wiki in your abscence and do renominate in the future. 
oppose,Definate Oppose per reasons already given. 
oppose,I would hope for him to get a few more edits to renominate. Editcountitis is very very bad but is also a sign of experience. Less than 1000 in more than a year IMO is too low 
oppose,Weak oppose very short answers to the questions concerns me...if the answers were lengthened a little more and a little more editing I would support. 
oppose,Oppose weakly per reasons already mentioned. 
oppose,Try to keep your chin up and not take this too hard ya' hear? 
support,Go on then... I would have hoped for more detailed answers to the questions but still good editor. 
support,unlikely to abuse admin tools. Not sure where Svest's questions are going the answers seem pretty obvious. 
support,Good editor. This user is unlikely to abuse admin tools 
support,Benefit of doubt support good enough. [[Image:Flag_of_Europe_and_Austria.svg|20px]] 
support,Good editor whom I think will not abuse the tools. 
support,Clearly does a beneficial job for Wikipedia and an efficient one. I am only bothering to add my positive vote though in order to attempt to cancel out the arrogance which can be seen below me in the form of the opposing voters.— Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by 
support,It's painful on the fence and I've occasionally run into this user and found them amiable no reason to assume that they'd abuse AdminPowersTM. [[user:Celestianpower|Cel]][[WP:ESP|e]]
oppose,Objection lack of experience. 
oppose,I'm not really sure that the motivation given in the answers below makes the grade for a selfnom. Anyone can get rollback button by installing godmode lite. There are only a couple of hundred Project: space edits (so count the edits see if I care) and very very few Talk and User_talk: edits. Edits in those latter two are especially important since a demonstrated ability to reliably interact carefully is important. I think I slightly wider experience base is a good thing to seek from a wouldbe admin and that will also reveal to the candidate the lack of depth in his answers to the questions. 
oppose,per Splash and his accepting his own selfnom shows his inexperience. 
oppose,per above and his answers to the question. 
oppose,Lack of wiki namespace and talk edits. 
oppose,An acceptable number of edits but that's never definitive. Get a little more experience and you'll pass for sure. 
oppose,per Splash. Gain more experience return in six months or so. 
oppose,FSF's sense of humor aside I don't think lb4 understands the whole score yet in regards to being an admin. Head over to [[user:WikiFanatic|WikiFanatic]] he likes to help with building up experience and understanding for rfas. 
oppose,you've done a lot of good work but adminship is a big responsibility and it's for more than just reverting. 
oppose,please set/enable your email id. 
support,As the nominator. 
oppose,Extremely rude in [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/ThomasK/1|his previous nomination]] an almost arrogant response to the questions no admin goals (doesn't even know the name of the deletion page and could fight vandals now) and no reason to become an admin. Strong object. 
oppose,I must regretfully oppose. While I have no doubt that ThomasK is a valuable editor his relatively few edits in Wikipedia: and User talk: (about 100+ each see <http://kohl.wikimedia.org/~kate/cgibin/count_edits?user=ThomasK&dbname=enwiki the full Kate's Tool results>) along with the sparse interaction with other editors on his user talk page (even with the multiple removed comments <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AThomasK&diff=22317853&oldid=22317543>) combined with the brief and unconvincing replies on the questions lead me to oppose his nomination. However I would suggest that you be more active and then try again in 2 or 3 months. | [[User talk:Flcelloguy|A note? ]]</font color>| 
oppose,per [[user:Flcelloguy|Flcelloguy]].</sup/><p style="fontfamily: Bradley Hand ITC Comic Sans MS;">
oppose,per [[user:Flcelloguy|Flcelloguy]] and I have concerns about the [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/ThomasK/1|previous nomination]] as well. It will take a few months of contributions in my opinion to show that things have changed. Should not have renominated again so soon. 
oppose,The answers given below do not impress me nor does the attitude Thomas displayed last time around. Thomas appears to be a perfectly competent editor unfortunately I do not believe he has shown the necessary ability to communicate constructively which is so important for an administrator. 
oppose,I was going to abstain from voting on this but I'm opposing due to ThomasK's responses to votes on this very RfA. Admins need to be able to take criticism in stride. [[User_talk:bmicomp|(talk]] 
support,This should be no big deal. 
oppose,Not really enough evidence of good interaction with others. The replies given on his talk page are so brief and brusque as to be on the thin edge of politeness and one of them was only answered today despite being posted in April. One example says just "never mind" as a clear dismissal and others don't indicate a tendency to engage in a friendly manner. There's an alarming lack of use (and lack of proper use) of the edit summary too and some odd choices over what constitutes major (e.g. inserting an image) and minor (e.g. removing a link) both of which could be controversial actions. Whilst I don't think golden prose maketh an admin the selected pages on his user page are all stubs or slightlymorethanstubs and I'd like to see some sort of deeper contribution. Finally there is a very small amount of work in the Wikipedia: and talk: spaces and thus I think insufficient interaction in the more spiky parts of the 'pedia at the moment (esp. when coupled with the sparse brusque talk page). This all sounds like I hate him despite not having 'met' him. I don't mean it like that at all; being the first 'oppose' I figured I should just be thorough. In short: come back in a while having patched the gaps I mentioned and with a higher more balanced edit count and I'll be supportive. 
oppose,Like I see a sparse use of edit summaries and 's interactions with other users seem a bit on the gruff side ([[User_talk:Thorpe#Need_more_info|example]]). He also fails to display a particular commitment to janitorial tasks which I feel is very important for an admin. 
oppose,for now. Concur with Splash's comments. Still seems a bit too "green". 
oppose,I agree that this user has yet to reach the level of experience that adminship demands as per the comments above. Regarding edit summaries: while at times justification of an action is given more often than not the user fails to summarize what edits have actually been made and although there can be seen an improvement in marking edits as minor or major some instances are still questionable. Perhaps it would be good to peruse: [[Wikipedia:Minor_edit]] [[Wikipedia:Edit_summary]] and [[Wikipedia:Edit_summary_legend]] may be useful as well. The answers to the candidate questions suggest that the user while may have good intentions only has a vague knowlegde of Wikipedia procedures. Potentially suitable for sysopship but not at the current time. 
oppose,I agree with much of what has been said. 
oppose,Oppose. Three months short of my support threshold for potential admins. 
oppose,because of the talk page and lack of edit summaries. (I don't have a "time since joining" restriction; those are way too rigid.) 
oppose,admins need much better user interaction capacities. 
support,Extreme HowDareYou vote before the nominator support. [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,Super strong omgwtfbbq lollergazm support. Absolutely. 
support,Genuinely attempts to improve WP articles and I like his attitude of attaining "featured article" status as his goal. 
support,! 
support,Though it seems a bit more edit summaries would be nice. 
support,Not fair! Not fair! Redwolf... arrrgh!!! I wanted to nominate Tony myself. 
support,I have been impressed by Tony's handling of a dispute at [[United States]]. I think he would make a fine admin.[[Wikipedia:Esperanza|a]]
support,A good lad he'll go far
support,[[Wikipedia:Featured article candidates|FAC]] work indicates a commitment to the improvement of Wikipedia as a whole. 
support,I have no reservations. 
support,Wiki needs more comma's. 
support,Most certainly yes. Tony1 truly deserves being called an 'editor'; I've been impressed ever since he helped the wikidocs get [[Asthma]] featured. Does fabulous work—this guy is one of Wp's best copyeditors and I think he saves a lot of our work from being painful embarrassments. Very good manner good dispute resolution skills; X factor. Furthermore in David Gerard's immortal words "is not stupid or insane"; I'm sure that he'll take the trouble to learn up on those areas he's not currently familiar with before using any special buttons. Gets my strong support. 
support,[[WP:ESP|e]]
support,Sounds like a guy who does fabulous work 
support,for the Featured Guy! 
support,Just Came Back from Hurricane Wilma Sure 
support,of course. 
support,Good contrib's across namespaces as nominator notes. No problems with this user. 
support,The more prosewatchers we have on pedestals the better WP becomes. 
support,Tony has been helpful and courteous and has a valuable contribution to make 
support,On articles I've worked at the same time as Tony he has always explained his changes in edit comments and consulted on talk pages before making significant changes. Both important aspects many editors seem to ignore. (voting late to redress an earlier deliberate abstain Tony doesn't deserve the dumping he's getting further down this page). 
support,No brainer. His work on FAC has been indispensable and I really like the fact that he explains even minor copy edits often without being asked. We can all learn something from this user. Give the man those admin buttons. 
support,Tony is excellent at what he does and therefore asserts himself with confidence which others can construe as impertinence or aggresion. A little more forebearance on his part might be beneficial but this is a good editor with the project's best interests in mind. 
support,Seems like a nice & capable editor... So I'll support. 
support,Strong and through this support express my STRONG OPPOSITION to the [[Trial by ordeal]] the Rfa process seems to be degenerating into. This is how we lose so many excellent talented and thoughtful contributors. Are none of us entitled to express our strong opinions without running the risk of incurring a personal political pile on?! Do we not have the right to defend ourselves when we feel we are under unfair attack?! Can we not even be bothered to FORGIVE some percieved slight?! Or to extend to our colleagues the benefit of the doubt rather than to doubt their benefits?! If one of my dear friends were to nominate me today I would DECLINE rather than face running such a disgraceful gauntlet as that which unfolds below. I wonder how many of YOU would fare facing such a barrage of negativity. Would you be able to sit quietly and smile while your honor your integrity your personal charachter is being smeared in the mud? I think those who would DO NOT deserve to be admins. Those are the very ones who merely want some small crumb of status/reward/power/influence. Who will use their position as a personal TOY rather than a TOOL to make our encycleopedia and community better. Tony you may not win the vote this time but you've kept your honor though you may have lost your temper and you have my [[Ali G|respect]] Sir!
support,Tony is a great copyeditor who has helped me with several articles that I have been working on. From my personal experience I have not had any unpleasant interactions with him. 
oppose,Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeak Oppose just doesn't seem right to me. I don't know I just feel as though this person isn't ready more time I feel is needed. Atleast another month or so. 
oppose,Weee...eeak Oppose II. Try again in a few months and you'll pass by a landslide. (vote by 
oppose,Oppose. Can be quite difficult to work with on occasion and shows a general unfamiliarity with some elements of policy. I can see him making a good admin in the future but he's just not ready yet; see below for some reasons why. 
oppose,Oppose. At first I couched my doubts about Tony's readiness for adminship as a comment rather than an oppose see below to give him a chance to modify or distance himself from the tantrum I linked to <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AFeatured_article_candidates%2FSicilian_Baroque&diff=26585685&oldid=26579432> but he emphasizes that he stands by every word. OK. Other things too about his response make me dubious about adminship at the present time. I'm sorry I've never opposed an RFA before (that I can remember) but the way Tony dismisses my concern and refuses the information I ask for makes me wonder how he'll treat people who challenge him when/if he's an admin. I may well support at a later date but I'd just like to see a little more absorption of the best sides of wikiculture first. 
oppose,Possibly by Tony's supporters I am seen as the villain of the piece which is why I have hesitated before voting. Let it be quite clear I do not oppose because his wild threats here <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_article_candidates/Sicilian_Baroque> have been acted on anonymously here <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Featured_article_removal_candidates/Sicilian_Baroque> I'm sure he would not be so stupid as to act anonymously even if his behaviour inspires such actions in others. However his behaviour does concern me. I was not too lazy as he suggests to integrate his changes I had just spent nearly a full day attempting to do so before deciding I just didn't like them. This is the crux of my objection oppose his views and see what happens. At best it seems to me his behaviour generally borders on the bombastic. Doubtless he has talents but at the moment I feel it would not be wise for him to have powers which could possibly be misused if he is crossed. Besides which he seems to attempt to run the FA page quite well without them. 
oppose,Yeah I can't say I'm so confident that he won't throw a tantrum again while the editing is hot. Can't trust the admin powers to him; sorry. 
oppose,Errrr. This really doesn't feel good my gut says to vote yes because he's a good editor but my brain says to vote oppose because he has a bit too much trouble with other editors. And my brain is the one that votes. Maybe if he can get through another three months without substantial conflict? 
oppose,I am not happy with what I see here. Editors who cannot handle conflict well are not admin candidates and I am not even pleased with the way that Tony has handled the conflict of this RfA itself let alone the conflicts he's been in over on FAC/FARC. 
oppose,without prejudice. Tony1 is a good editor and a valuable part of FAC but I'm concerned about 1) time on project and edits in multiple spots so that we can see how he handles those who disagree 2) a passion for correcting things that might override the need to be courteous and considerate. Much of the time Tony1's criticisms of mistakes are legitimate and some of the time they are preferences; such is the case with all of us. What worries me is that he doesn't allow enough for differences of opinion for the legitimacy of others' views. None of this is to cast any doubts whatever about Tony1's value to the project. He's a first class contributor and editor but I'm concerned that we don't yet know enough to assess what he'd do in a case of belligerant edits and serious differences of opinion. 
oppose,I realize that both this and the featured article process can be stressful but tantrums are not acceptable. With some more time and an opportunity to cool off I trust that Tony1 will be able to earn my trust in the future. 
oppose,Would like to see activity in vandalfighting dispute resolution or other adminrelated areas before supporting. If Tony1 wants to stick to editing and FACs which is certainly valuable! he doesn't need the mop & bucket. Also being an admin makes it more likely that one will be "attacked" in various ways which seems like a problem. Finally I don't understand Tony1's explanation of why he cannot provide diffs or even article names for the conflicts he mentions in Question 3. Everything in Wikipedia is public so there is no privacy issue but if we don't know what article we're looking for combing through months of his contribs is pointless. 
oppose,Week oppose. per many of the reasons above. Still needs a little more time and more edits. 
oppose,and ask that you reconsider quitting the project when this RfA closes. I believe your contributions to FAC are valuable just adminship isn't right for you right now. 
oppose,not ready quite yet Tony please dont take everything as a personal attack. Hell i've failed 2 RFA's myself. 
oppose,Reluctant oppose. From the endorsements above and what I've seen personally Tony's clearly a great editor and normally would be exactly the kind of person we need on the project. At the same time I feel I have to vote oppose to anyone adds to their RfA that "I now hate WP with a vengeance." This statement's understandable; the candidate's been provoked and feels under serious pressure. At the same time though can we really give the admin buttons to somebody who currently hates the project? I'd join Cyberjunkie in urging Tony to withdraw his nomination until he's feeling better about things. He's clearly future admin material just needs a little cooling off and a few cold ones. 
oppose,in complete agreement with Dvyost. I'm also afraid that Tony's little display here does indicate that he's not ready for adminship either. "Admins should be courteous and should exercise good judgment and patience in dealing with others"... 
oppose,Reluctantly oppose: nothing personal and I certainly do not want him to leave the project but the above interactions show this user is not ready at this time. 
oppose,Strongly oppose. The outbursts in green above are thoroughly unbecoming of an admin and the sentence somewhere below about "I hate conflict" just isn't going to make things work when the vandals and so on descend upon you. Then when you face your first disagreement on AN/I things will spiral out of control quickly. Anyone who threatens to leave WP over the outcome of an RfA simply isn't levelheaded and coolenough under fire to be an admin. Try again in a few more months if you can round off the rough edges. 
oppose,I am concerned with what he say in his answers in green. He sure seems to be a good contributor but he must learn that good contribution alone(even though very important) is not the only skill that takes to be an Admin and that those that opposes him do not put his perceived character maturity and personality on trial. 
oppose,Oppose. This is painful. If we could go back in time and never nominate Tony1 we'd all be a lot better off. If we had something else we could nominate him for like "outstanding and important contributer" we should have. Unfortunately this RFA still has to be dealt with. And I have to change my vote based entirely on Tony1's edits to this RFA. This isn't "petty" it's responding to new data. Tony is showing a compliete inability to deal calmly with controversy but worse is interpreting virtually every negative comment as a personal attack. Viewing anybody's comments here as a personal attack seems like a heck of a stretch to me. This isn't admin temperment. 
oppose,would have been willing to support but for Tony's behaviour on this RfA [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
oppose,A look through his list of contributions shows that Tony has been an excellent editor. Admin status is selfevidently not required for this. It is required for such matters as the dispassionate application of rules. And for that you need to demonstrate a certain coolness (perhaps even humor) when under stress in addition of course to a pretty good understanding of what the rules are or at least an awareness that the rules might not be obvious and might need looking up. I don't see this demonstrated in the green text above. I don't think it's necessary to show this with examples but if Tony insists I'll reluctantly do this. However two things that Tony writes in <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_adminship%2FTony1&diff=26781078&oldid=26779217 one of his edits> (which as I write still stands) merit quick and simple response. He says: But in just a few days WP has turned from highly productive fun to utter misery for me; this process has succeeded in destroying a valuable Wikipedian. No doubt Giano Hoary and Bishonin whatever she calls herself will take delight at this; but it's very bad for WP. Having been very loyal I now hate WP with a vengeance. (1)No I take no delight in any aspect of this RfA or Tony's described or promised reactions to it. (2)I'm not going to entrust the administrative mop broom and kryptonite to anybody who says he or she "hate<s> WP with a vengeance". And lastly I second <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_adminship%2FTony1&diff=26781770&oldid=26781078 Cyberjunkie's suggestion above> and hope that Tony rereads it and reconsiders it. 
oppose,after viewing edits here at this RfA. Frustration over [[Sicilian baroque]] seemed entirely appropriate to me. The above doesn't. 
oppose,Changing again per: "The nasty drubbing that I'll be giving WP on the net with my insider knowledge will just start a few days earlier" along with the other complete overeactions exhibited. Sorry .
oppose,It is with regret that I oppose this nomination. I'm very sorry Tony but your comments on this very RfA are not up to admin standard. I do hope that you continue with this great project and I can support your nomination at a later stage. 
support,Sometimes I find User G's comments on his talk page elliptical enough that they could end in "Grasshopper" but...everyone needs a friendly uncle. 
support,In the interactions I've had with Uncle G I can't remember a single instance where I've thought his conduct less than exemplary. 
support,Fine. 
support,good contributor who works well with others. Userpage doesn't bother me in the least. 
support,[[User talk:RickK|K]] 22:41 Apr 9 2005 (UTC). Good editor manages to proceed through the minefields of VfD without becoming sullied. 
support,Very Very Strong I've recently worked pretty closely with Uncle G on tranwikification of articles to Wiktionary and he's very level headed and a great contributor to Wikipedia. People who oppose Uncle G because he doesn't have a user page need to "...unlearn the false inference that they are making about people with no user pages...". 
support,a careful user. all this "get a userpage" mumbojumbo is silly. 
support,User pages are nice trivialities not anything essential. 
support,lack of a userpage is irrelevant 
support,I'd go neutral because of the lack of a userpage but Uncle G is a very hard worker. 
support,I have seen Uncle G's work and it seems like he is a hard worker. I think the lack of a userpage is irrelevant because he can slap something on in less than a few seconds. 
support,Surely there are more useful reasons for opposition than lacking a userpage? 
support,I thought he was already an admin. 
support,[[Ditto (Pokémon)|ditto]] 
support,hey it's my nomination. I'd create a redirect from his userpage to his talk page if people think that'd help. 
support,Userpage objections are nonsense. 
support,He's not evil my requirements are met. 
support,I have accepted his reason for having no userpage. Uncle G is level headed and helpful and we need more such administrators. 06:20 12 Apr 2005 (UTC) Affirming vote. 
support,Good user.
support,Would be a shame for this nomination to fail for reasons as trivial as someone not having a user page. 
support,It would be nice to use minor edit checkbox sometimes (the one on the left single click is enough really) to give hint to people on RC check. 
support,(if I've enough contrib's to vote here A user who reminds us all that one should not judge a contributor from the colo(u)r of hir user page link. This red link is a "face to the community" albeit not a standard one. Who said it had to be? 
support,Although I mostly know this editor through [[Wikinews]] from what I've seen over there he'd make a great admin here. Not having a user page is of no practical consequence. 
support,Good contributions and there is nothing wrong with not having a user page. 
support,Boatloads of good work and the lack of a user page (until forced) was more than fine suggesting that vanity doesn't override decisions. (and nice workaround to the "problem" now that I look closer 
support,Good editor knowledgeable of policies already involved in various areas of cleanup. I would feel comfortable handing him the keys to the janitor closet. 
support,Trollslayer extrordinaire who is a vital part of VfD. Also he's left one of the most eloquent and evenhanded statements I've ever read over on SamuraiClinton's RfC page. Just get a user page. Become the "blue Uncle" we know you can be. 
support,I say this with all due respect to those who oppose the nomination. The nominee is clearly not an opportunist: Despite knowing that much of the opposition will cease if he creates a user page he continues not to have one. This behavior indicates that Uncle G would probably not change his personal view merely to obtain more votes. 
support,Uncle G comes across as patient fairminded and good at explaining things. I think he'll be good with a mop. 
support,Will he misuse admin powers? I strongly doubt it based on what I've seen of him and on the endorsements above and that's good enough for me. 
support,I don't think the user page is a big deal and that seems to be the only oposition to his promotion he is a good editor
support,I note that many of the oppose votes are caused by the lack of a user page; while this is unusual it is not grounds to decline adminship. Uncle G's enabling of his email shows he is responsive to fair comment.
support,Uncle G has now linked to his explanation below from the top of his talk page which is good enough for me. 
support,Frankly I'm stunned that so many people are opposing simply because Uncle G doesn't have the equivalent of "Hi! My name is: Uncle G" 
support,The lack of a user page is quirky and probably an error in judgement but I don't see any other evidence that Uncle G would be anything other than a good and helpful administrator. I actually admire the fact that Uncle G has not created one given the obvious fact that he could create one assuage the discomfort of those opposing him solely because of this be made an administrator and then delete his user page. Good sense of both independence and honor there. 
support,I'll support him for the same reason others were opposing me 
support,The quality of one's edits and work here on the Wikipedia should determine if one should be an admin not just a simple user page. Maybe he likes the color red? 
support,Uncle G exceeds all material requirements for an admin. We do not expect nor do we require admins to be yesmen or to toe the party line for matters unrelated to their ability to function as an admin. That a missing userpage complicates RC monitoring is a sign we need to improve our software and not a reason to punish valuable contributors.
support,I don't feel that the issue of a lack of a userpage should make or break Uncle G's adminship. 
oppose,An administrator should present a "face" to the community by having a user page. If this user creates one I will almost certainly change my vote. 17:06 2005 Apr 9 (UTC) Or create at least a redirect to the talk page. For an admin to have no user page at all would be confusing to new users and I respectfully don't agree that is a trivial thing. 19:24 2005 Apr 11 (UTC) The main reason I now strongly oppose is not the user page but the whole pattern and style of communication. See the comments below. 
oppose,My experience with this user at [[Category talk:Move to Wiktionary]] was disappointing to put it mildy. It seemed he purposely took comments out of context to make himself look right and his stubborness to continually delete his user page is pathetic. If Uncle G wants to be independant/special/wild card/free spirit/whatever then great; he can continue being that way as a regular editor. The contributions he selected for the answer section below are underwhelming. His edit summaries of "Rewritten from sources" ([[Albert Mackey]][[Emmett Ashford]]) lead me to believe he rewrote sections from sources not that what he was removing stuff because it was copied from sources. Frankly from the way he handled the issues with his user page (by CSDing it) and the examples he selected from his contributions I don't think this person really cares if he's admin or not. We have enough admins as it is we don't need to force it on people who are hemming and hawwing about it. 
oppose,To me not having a user page marks you as someone who has been on for a week or a vandal with a user name. I patrol the new pages list a lot and I mostly check the pages of people with no user page of no user name. 
oppose,for now. I originally thought that the lack of a user page wasn't a big deal but it's starting to bug me. Though I don't like to support broad generalizations it is useful to distinguish between red names and blue names when going through my Watchlist or "Recent Changes". While I don't expect that EVERY user create a user page our admins should definitely be expected to support the best practices on wikipedia and I believe that a user page is one of those practices. His refusal to even create a nominal user page is troubling indicates a stubbornness to a degree that is inadvisable when dealing with admin powers and seems almost like a disruption of wikipedia to prove a point. I hate to do it but i'm going to have to oppose. 
oppose,No user page. 
oppose,I hate to do this but the more I think about it the more it bothers me. Administrators must interact with the community and a user page is part of the face one presents. It need not be complex (mine was two short sentences for months) but administrators are trusted members with additional abilities and I feel they should make some effort to connect with the community by posting something. Not to do somehow doesn't seem in the spirit of openness and transparency that I feel administrators should promote especially regarding themselves. And it seems unprofessional. I also am concerned that Uncle G made no effort here to address this concern or even to explain why he thought it was irrelevant. Administrators should be sensitive to concerns regarding their behavior. However I understand his lack of comment as from his answer to question 1 and his comment on Radiant's talk page it appears that adminship is not something he strongly wants nor is it very helpful to the types of activities he normally does. Of course some would argue that the best administrators are those who aren't crazy about pursuing adminship but between my perceived lack of benefit to him and the lack of a user page it's enough to push me to oppose. If Uncle G wishes to stand out from everyone else he is free to make his signature red or whatever he likes. 
oppose,The lack of a user page troubles me. There isn't of course a rule that having one is mandatory for an admin but at the same time that this user lacks one gives me enough pause to oppose this nomination. 
oppose,With great sadness I feel I have to oppose this nomination which also means I will not decide on this nomination leaving it to another bureaucrat's discretion. I say "with great sadness" because Uncle G seems like a fine decent and principled editor. However I feel that it sets a bad precedent for an Administrator not to have a User Page as opposed to an Editor not to have one. That is because admins are the public face of Wikipedia and where others turn for help and advice. It is not a good thing for an admin to not have a user page that at least announces that he/she is an admin and expresses the admin's commitment (or lack thereof) to engaging the community and perhaps state those areas where s/he feels s/he can be most helpful. Therefore I oppose this nomination. 
oppose,I am afraid that the only interaction I have had with this user resulted in his descending into a rant at me for not having read through several long discussion pages. I am not certain he is of sufficient mentality to have this distinction.([[User talk:Smoddy|t]]
oppose,Having an empty user page is not good. I find the explanation for that below unsatisfactory. 
oppose,Oppose. Lack of a userpage is inconsiderate for anyone given the time it wastes for people on RC patrol. If someone doesn't want to be an admin that's their choice. For an admin a voluntary postion to be part of the visible face of Wikipedia its unnaceptable. 
oppose,VERY strongly oppose. Clearly Uncle G doesn't accept community consensus because he still refuses to create a userpage. To me the arrogance of not listening to the community is worse than not having a userpage. And in turn it's not the lack of a userpage that bothers me as much as the red link and its implications on Recent Changes votes polls and other such things. It's disruptive and it wastes everyone's time. [[Wikipedia:Don't disrupt Wikipedia to make a point|We're here to build an encylopedia and be part of a wiki community not to make an ideological point]]. If Uncle G simply redirects his userpage to his user talk page then I would support</font color>. 
oppose,for now and I do so reluctantly. From what I've seen of Uncle G's edits he's a good contributor an' all but it's hard enough to form an impression of the people we're working with when we are all interacting pseudonymously over the internet even when they have user pages. Admins I feel should present a face to the community. Even if he were to create a fairly uninformative or out of date user page like mine or countless others' it would at least be an improvement on a red link. 
oppose,I read Uncle G's lengthy explanation below and it by itself is enough for me to vote no. I can appreciate the fight against the stigma of a blank user page but the fact of the matter is that it does make things easier for other people. 
oppose,It's fine for editors to contribute without a user page but it's not fine for admins. It rather seems like a policeman or any other official insisting on performing the job without wearing a uniform to identify himself properly. Uncle G needs neither user page nor adminship to continue his great work. 
oppose,Similarly I'm concerned by the lack of a user page. Well not so much concerned as he certainly has the right not to have one and doesn't seems in any way to have sought adminship; but nontheless I would be uncomfortable with an admin without one (as it'd preclude identifying himself as one which I feel ought to be if not a formal requirement then at least a general expectation). I'd also be in any event disinclined to actively support without some stronger statement on performing admin tasks (again understandable in an "unsought" nomination and not a reflection on him as an editor in any respect). 
oppose,due to lack of user page. I respect Uncle G's right not to have a user page and his desire to be judged on his contributions alone but when weighing up whether users should be given admin powers I need to know more about the candidate. I would extend that to those who deliberately have obscure userpages. Perhaps it should be a requirement for Admins to have user pages. 
oppose,Great contributor but I have to oppose. A simple redirect to his talk would take care of a very annoying red link. I echo Neutrality's comments especially as well as Dbiv's. 
oppose,He does not have a user page; also please see his comments on [[Talk:Teenybopper|"Teenybopper"'s talk page]]. 
oppose,on the grounds that I cannot agree with the following comment made by as part of the nomination "Also has been friendly with explaining the relevant processes to new users.". When I was a new user who was trying to do the right thing by speedying certain articles he made comments that came across as curt and a little condescending. I won't debate whether his comments were correct but I still feel that his approach was inconsistent with the attitude I would expect to see from an Admin (such behaviour greatly increases the risk of bad reactions from both valid contributors and vandals). If he could prove that this flaw no longer exists then in all other aspects he seems fine. 
oppose,The lack of userpage is no big deal for me but Uncle G is being quite rebarbative and quick to take offense in some of his responses on this very page. I do like to see admins ready to assume good faith and to work towards defusing rather than escalating or even initiating quarrels especially on their RfA page (considering that that is the one time and place people are likely to be as nice as they know how). 
support,as nominator. Molotov is extremely geneous with bestowing Barnstars more proof of his good nature toward Wikipedia and Wikipedians. 
support,Dealt with well before really like him thought about nominating him myself.~ 
support,THE STRONGEST SUPPORT A PERSON COULD ACTUALLY GET Its about damn time . I would have nominated him myself but I read somewhere that he was waiting a bit. Great guy Wikipedia will certainly benefit. </sup/><p style="fontfamily: Bradley Hand ITC Comic Sans MS;">
support,Administratsysoptorise 
support,! 
support,I SUPPORT YOU!
support,great editor who has made some great contribs on Russiarelated articles. perfect person for adminship. 
support,sooner or later I would have nominated him myself. 
support,Please get that preview button under control though .... there are sometimes five edits within a single minute (!) with the same (unfortunately unuseful) edit summary. Slightly more careful edits + better edit summaries == happy me. Other than that looks good. 
support,No prob with Molotov should make a fine admin. 
support,I do believe that he shall be a successful administrator. 
support,a very useful addition 
support,calling someone an idiot one time should not rule him out of adminship. Besides this [[jeff merkey]] guy seems to stir people up ;) 
support,Of course. [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,Will be a good admin. 
support,Someone below cited angry outbursts but outbursts don't bother me much. What's really important for an admin is to generally have the right course. 
support,He'll do a good job. 
support,Of course... 
support,Even though i dont normally agree with u in VFD u will still make a great adminirador 
oppose,Regrettably I'm going to have to . As an admin you're going to have runins with lots of unpleasant people if you can't keep your cool in such cases (or even worse feel [[User_talk:V._Molotov#NPA|entitled to break the rules because people are mean to you]]) you might want to concentrate on other aspects of wikipedia. 
oppose,While the frustration is understandable in such circumstances I feel that a personal attack made so recently is sufficient reason to oppose. I think that admins definitely need to be able to stay cool under trying circumstances. Again is a fine editor and has IMO far more positive contributions than negative. However he's young and perhaps too excitable at this point. 
oppose,per fvw and Friday 
oppose,fvw and Friday's comments ring very true for me. Also in January and April of this year this user engaged in a campaign of harassing . (See [[User talk:24.164.211.25]] <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:DreamGuy&diff=12586090&oldid=12585895><http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ADreamGuy&diff=12549273&oldid=12542655> for a small sample) He has repented and mended his ways since then but not enough time has passed for me to support him. Also I don't put much weight on Barnstars and welcome messages. They seem to make people happy which is great but they are unrelated to admin work. Because of the enthusiastic support above I am wavering between Oppose and Neutral but I don't feel confident that his interpersonal skills have matured that much in 5 1/2 months. [[User talk:FreplySpang|(talk)]] 04:46 21 September 2005 (UTC) After seeing the link that posted below I am not wavering any more. 
oppose,This <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Gadugi&diff=prev&oldid=23353267> is just not acceptable; I don't care how provoked it was. 
oppose,Sorry but I am forced to agree with Fvw and Dragons flight those outbursts just days before your adminship request gives a very negative impression. An admin must be at least somewhat gracious in the face of adversity. 
oppose,The recent unacceptable conduct cited above is the reason I'm opposing. Assuming this was an isolated incident I would support in a few months. 
oppose,Per ; Admins must be able to keep a cool level head. This behavior clearly shows the opposite. I can not in good conscience support a nominee for admin when they exhibit behavior live that. 15:44 21 September 2005 (UTC) Addendum: Seeing the notes below I remember now that I have had interactions with this nominee before. The harsh attack as noted by is not isolated. When the user was relatively new to Wikipedia he got involved in a vandalism war against a user that he had a dispute with. I attempted to mentor him and he appeared to want to contribute in more effective ways. He was thankful at the time for my belief that he could become a better editor. I had hoped he would maintain a level head moving forward from that incident a long time ago. I'm disappointed that has not been the case. While I strongly encourage the nominee to continue to strive to be a better editor (and he has become better) I can not see any reasonable basis for this nominee becoming an admin. 
oppose,Oppose the link provided by Dragons flight confirms my discomfort. By way of observation and advice the nominator's adminship was long delayed due significantly to a few similar outbursts. He finally received it after demonstrating his continued dedication to Wikipedia improved behavior and above all willingness to take and act upon constructive criticism. As a further note I think the new username is a poor choice as it gives the appearance of attempting to encourage/justify this sort of behavior (it's also a little borderline under the [[Wikipedia:Username|username policy]]). 
oppose,Oppose after reviewing some of the editor's contributions including the link provided by Dragons flight above. 
oppose,Oppose for reasons cited above. "Courtesy in the face of any insult" should be the first goal and guiding principle of all administrators. Candidate should review [[m:WikipediAhimsa]] for a general idea of what I'm referring to. 
support,Software related edits look OK to me. Dealing with vandalism is tough: the user should be thanked for it not get suspected. I wrote weak support because (a) not all edits have edit summary (b) some activity on ViP VFD etc would be helpful for future admin. 
support,CryptoDerk brought up a heated exchange we had. It was a mere misunderstanding in which I deleted something he had put some time into. Personally I would have preferred that he just told me what I deleted straight out (obviously I didn't know) but we long since resolved the issue and he apologized to me. But anyway I think he's good enough to support. 
oppose,No way. Took a cursory look at his talk page. Following <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3ATerri_Schiavo&diff=12201387&oldid=12201349 these edits> which appear to be cosmetic Vikreykja reverted saying it was vandalism then Mark said they were good faith edits and Vik responded with I was in no mood to assume good faith ... If you continue I am afraid you may well be RFCed. And if that's not enough right above it is a heated exchange with TheCustomOfLife! 
oppose,Not that I'm saying that someone who does something like that should never be an admin but it should require some sort of cooling off period (like a few months and a few hundred edits) 
oppose,Not no forever but no for now. We have to always assume good faith not just when the mood takes us.
oppose,for the reasons stated above. See comment below. 
oppose,for two reasons: the conflict stated above and you don't meet my other . 
oppose,I'm afraid. I don't know Vik and wasn't going to vote until I saw the exchange concerning Alterego's edit on [[Talk:Online poker]]. Aside from the unnecessary hostility it shows a very unhealthy attitude toward policy pages: Vik asserts that "the rules" should be upheld even where they are obviously counterproductive. This shows a basic unfamiliarity with how things are done on Wikipedia. Or at least I hope that's not how we do things on Wikipedia now... 
oppose,Will reconsider in the future after a lot more edits. 
support,Nominate and support. 
support,for a very fine contributor. Shows a willigness to strive for 100% criticismfree performance. 
support,and please do use edit summaries 
support,Lemme get this straight his 60% use of edit summaries means... he'll abuse admin tools? Heh how very asinine. [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
support,positive editor. 
support,A pleasant positive and helpful editor likely to be civil in any use of admin tools see no reason to oppose. 
support,I also feel that adminship applications should not be used to enforce rules of conduct beyond the [[Wikipedia:Five pillars|five pillars]] so I find the edit summary discussion to be entirely irrelevant to the nomination.
support,We need more admins. 
support,[[User talk:Doc glasgow|(?)]] 22:36 1 November 2005 (UTC) seems good enough and has promised to use edit summaries in future 
support,How could I be more eloquent than ? 
support,just because I want to. 
support,Good edits levelheaded on talk pages. I'm sure as an admin they will be more diligent about edit summaries. 
support,I see no reason why edit summaries would make such a big difference?! It's utterly stupid! On that note I better start using edit summaries pronto!!
support,Jimbo= founder benevolent dictator and god emperor of the Wikiverse. Imagetagging and lack of edit summeries are STUPID reasons to oppose someone. It makes editcountitis look sensible by comparison.
support,The edit count is not that bad. Besides mine was even lower yet it is over 85% for my last 100 edits. And I will keep trying to get it up.
oppose,scant use of edit summaries. 
oppose,per Durin note on imagetagging. Need more time to learn finer points of Wikiprocess. 
oppose,per others. 
oppose,as per Freestylefrappe. 
oppose,For mine edit summaries alone are not a reason to oppose (tho' I agree they're important). However the combination of few edit summaries lack of care with images and advertising your RfA on other users' talkpages (or in one case harassing an oppose voter) lead me to one inescapable conclusion ... oppose. Sorry dude. 
oppose,per [[User_talk:MarkGallagher#My_RfA_2|comment]] on fuddlemark's talk page. I don't personally believe that ANY comments should be made by an admin candidate about people's voting. Trying to get someone to change their vote is extremely questionable. 
oppose,per Ral315 above and OwenX's point <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Wackymacs&diff=27279840&oldid=27275261 here>. I find the user's argumentative approach to Oppose votes quite worrying not least the way he argues with Fuddlemark wellconsidered comment below that his argumentative approach to Oppose votes is actually "kind". No it isn't. Let me note preemptively that I would not like to be asked to consider withdrawing this vote or to receive any message about it. I have already thought about it quite carefully. 
oppose,If he makes such a bad impression in his nomination how will he deal with the responsibility of being an admin? [[User talk:Rspeer|r</span]]>
support,unlikely to abuse administrator tools. 
support,He's a bureaucrat in nlwiki fer cryin' out loud. I think we can trust him with the tools even if he won't actually be using them much in enwiki. The precedent exists... see .[[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e</span]]>
support,It's not about how much you can do with the tools it's having the sense to use them appropriately. 
support,experience on NL and has a good reason for wanting the tools here. (
support,If we can't trust bureaucrats (from other Wikipedia editions) whom are we supposed to trust? [[Image:Flag_of_Europe_and_Austria.svg|20px]] 
support,I already put my comment here (see below) and see my reasoning confirmed. 
support,This user is one of the founders of Dutch wikipedia where the admin procedures are similar to here. There should be no question that he can be trusted with the admin tools here as well. 
support,Strong though some have opposed because of the number of edits Walter is a dedicated Wikipedian who has long earned my trust. Though not particularly active here at en: he is extremely active at meta and nl and is one of the most trustworthy Wikipedians. 
support,we have other admins for technical purposes only.
support,Certainly trustworthy. 
support,I think there should be some kind of accelerated process for those with high permissions on other Wikimedia projects since the normal ways we use of assessing worth on the English Wikipedia (particularly edit count) give a misleading impression. 
support,Good guy won't abuse rights why worry? He might possibly do something useful which is enough for me. 
support,No reason not to. 
support,Questions anwered. Also I believe that sysop status should carry over somewhat but not entirely. He does have to make sure he is familar with en. policy. Still sysops are not much different elsewhere. He will quickly learn anything he still needs to here. Note that I would normally oppose for low sysop activity but he is also a bureaucrat so there is not much too lose. 
support,summed it up well. 
support,per above. Just because a user won't use it much doesn't mean it isn't worth giving it to them. 
support,A different case indeed and I was inclined to agree with silsor below (can install MediaWiki) but not everyone can install MediaWiki and it is relatively a hassle. Ultimately Walter can be trusted as a Wikipedia user adminship is generally meant to be no big deal and local policy has breached by admins before I get the impression this is much less likely with someone like Walter who is bound to be careful. 
support,convincing explanation was previously not convinced of the need earlier. 
support,Give the guy a promotion. Just because He wants to experiment with the new tools doesn't mean He'll abuse 'em. 
support,Smart trustworthy user who is not likely to abuse administrator tools. 
support,Trustworthy user no big deal. [[Image:Yemen flag large.png|24px]] 
support,Assuming good faith here though I still don't quite get it. 
support,A valid if unusual reason for wanting access to the admin toolbox. Seems unlikely to abuse it. 
support,support 
support,Walter has proven to be very trustworthy. In all his years on Wikipedianl I have never seen him perform any action that was disputed. He never misused his moderatorpossibilities and he is very active in informing the dutch community in international wikiaffairs. 
oppose,you'll need to do more on enWikipedia and demonstrate that you are familiar with its procedures before getting access. Also if you don't anticipate doing sysop duties you probably don't need access to the sysop tools. [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
oppose,as well. As Deathphoenix said above f you're not going to be doing real sysop stuff on enwiki then by your own admission it's not necessary for you to have access to sysop tools. 
oppose,strong Oppose per the above comments. I strongly suggest the candidate withdraw his nomination. 
oppose,per above. User does not seem to be active here. 
oppose,per above. Lack of activity. 
oppose,I'm concerned about wanting the tools for "experiment(ing) whit the cool new functions". Combined with low ammounts of project interaction (User Talk Policies/Proceedures). 
oppose,I'm nominating myself because I would like to have access to the sysop functions of this Wiki. 
oppose,I'm profoundly uncomfortable with the tone of the nomination the answers to the questions and the experience here on en:. The nom and answers seem to reveal some considerable misunderstanding of that nebulous concept of "how we do things" and a fairly natural grasp of it is important for an admin. He's a trusted user elsewhere but seems to need some more mileage here before being adminned. Sysop buttons are not cool new toys for the playing with; please don't put that kind of thing in your next nomination. 
oppose,However compelling the reason to test the new stuff out here on en beforehand I still do not think that warrants admin ship and believe it is the wrong way to go 'bout it. 
oppose,If Walter wanted to be an admin for reasons other than testing it would be a different matter (and I probably would not vote either way). To be an admin purely to play around with the MediaWiki software is a poor reason to apply to be an admin. You can install MediaWiki on your laptop/desktop if you really want to play around with it. It's not that hard to install (and installing multiple mediawiki on one system is pretty easy too). 
oppose,per the above. 
oppose,Given the concerns raised by others I feel this nomination should not succeed. If Walter reapplies later with more thorough answers to the questions and with a real sense of wanting to be an admin at En for reasons other than experimental whimsy I will glady support. 
oppose,very mildly. I just can't get over the grammatical issues. I think that administrators should be chosen above all for the quality of their entries and your selfnom frightens me. 
oppose,It's pretty much been said above. Grammar selfnom(a negative mark in my book) him saying that he hasn't really contributed anything on English Wikipedia etc. He might be great on .NL this is .en the big show baby. You'll have to do better than "I want to tool around with sysop powers" to convince me that you're ready for the job. 
oppose,Oppose with complete respect. I looked at this RFA and did not recognize the candidate's name. The reason for this is now quite clear. Despite his strong presence on the Dutch Wikipedia Walter seems to be only a casual contributor to the English one. Walter edits in short spurts then disappears sometimes for weeks with a net average of one edit per three days. 
oppose,Reluctantly oppose. Sorry Walter. I support your very hard work on Dutch Wiki and would be very pleased to support you in future but I'd like to see more involvement on en first. 
support,questions are little different then I expected (its not about who wins BTW).. and you should accept up there... anyway sure why not 
support,lots of Wikipedia namespace edits (<http://kohl.wikimedia.org/~kate/cgibin/count_edits?user=Water+Bottle&dbname=enwiki edit counts>) so probably familiar with policy and procedures. Seems like a good editor. 
oppose,Based only on the questions below: It takes two to edit war. Anyone who needs to use [[WP:3RR]] instead of [[WP:HEC]] or [[WP:1RR]] is not suited for adminship by my criteria (see comments for motivation) . If you can provide a later situation which you resolved more amicably I'm willing to change my vote. In other news the edit criteria by the neutrals below are really too high. They might want to reconsider their position. (1500 edits and 3 months is already insanely difficult to achieve: you need to be a top 1000 editor to do that). 
oppose,Insufficient evidence of admin qualities at this point in time. With a further three months or so of editing and contributing to Wikipedia my vote would probably switch to support. 
oppose,Change to Oppose. There are 26 headings at his talk page and 0 archives. I don't vote people based on headings or anything but he's been around since November and thats all teh interaction there's been? I think the #1 quality an admin must possess is the ability to interact well with other users. [[Wikipedia:Esperanza|e]]
oppose,65 edits to the user talk namespace doesn't give enough oneonone user interaction to judge from. Will support in a month or two. 
support,I assume good faith! 
support,I appreciate his answer on the edit summary question. . 
support,Two things lead me to support: Firstly Raul's endorsement. Secondly his defence and championing of proper English spelling and grammar. And by that I mean British English. 
oppose,Strongly oppose. 1) Arbitrarily changes grammar and spelling (systemically and en masse) from [[American English]] to [[British English]]. 2) Almost never leaves an edit summary. 3) Doesn't have a userpage that tells anything about him or his wikibeliefs. 4) Has never shown an interest in the project namespace or administrative chores. 5) Copyediting is not an "admin chore"; Wereon listed it as a "sysop duty" below. 
oppose,I'm not happy about planned blocking of IPs. 
oppose,The comment about IP adresses below concerns me as does his talismanic wielding of the Manual of Style (which is not policy). I do not believe he has shown enough community interaction janitoring skills or understanding of policy for me to support. 
oppose,Activities such as copyediting would not be aided by admin powers. I'm also concerned about the proposed blocking of public IPs. 
oppose,Strongly oppose due to proposed IP blocking. 
oppose,*shudder* 
oppose,I'm not keen on the Manual of Style rigidity (it's not policy and even those who edit it don't agree with much of its content) the proposed blocking of IP addresses used by libraries (some people may have no other way of editing) or that many or most of his edits are minor. 
oppose,Banning people in libraries from editing an encyclopedia? 
oppose,; interesting attitudinal link between IP and MOS comments. We need more flexibility not less. 
oppose,Oppose for various reasons also given above. 
oppose,Nothing personal but I think this user needs to learn to be more of a team player before being handed the keys. 
oppose,due to the issue of banning libraries from editing. You could use the same argument to just completely block AOL from editing. 
oppose,Umm don't ban public IPs as a "preemptive strike" don't consider copyediting "admin powers" and basically don't do anything you said you'd do in the section below and I might vote for you next time. Oppoze. 
oppose,Directly from the Manual of Style: "Clear informative and unbiased writing is always more important than presentation and formatting. Writers are not required to follow all or any of these rules". Also consider responding to the criticisms without attacking. I certainly wouldn't want that treatment from an admin. 
oppose,seems apt to get into editing fights over minor issues. 
oppose,An example of the worst possible candidate in my opinion. 
oppose,As someone who has done everyone of his 5000+ edits at public library terminals I'm bothered by his notion that libraries should be blocked. 
support,Also love his userpage motto 
support,Cool. 
support,Excelent user. 
support,A keen and communicative user who'd make good use of admin tools. 
support,He annoys me sometimes which is why I am opposing is request for adminship. Therefore I support. 
support,I normally wait for the candidate to accept but I'll make an exception here. Come on Weyes accept and help maintain the excellent [[WP:AIV]] you made ;). 
support,Deserving hardworking Wikicitizen! 
support,Sure; welcome to the cabal. | [[User_talk:Linuxbeak|Talk]] | 
support,RC Patrol could always use new people. 
support,The more RC Patrol the better. 
support,I had asked him if he wanted to be nominated about 20 days or so ago. He's very good at fighting vandalism. 
support,A worthwhile nominee to be the first one on whom I've voted in four months. 
support,I still strongly oppose this nomination which of course means I support! 
support,RC patroller par excellence. 
support,The problem with IP address etc is that spamers persistently add their links here. While this was has been solved effectively for articles like Game or Real Estate those people selling IP tools ignore any warnings or recommendations put there. I once wrote HTML comment into Externals links section asking people to describe new links and avoid redundancies and it didn't work for long. So until the reasonable set of links gets agreed and enforced periodical cleanups are useful. 
support,the same way I voted for on the previous nomination that Weyes turned down. 
support,I wish I had had the honour of nominating him. It would be really cool to give a user both their welcome message and their adminship nomiation. Oh well. It's great to see that you've come this far Weyes! 
support,You're not escaping the mop this time. 
support,quick before he escapes again! 
support,Warmly support Weyes especially for his RC work and his quest to make Wikipedia's external links less random. 
support,I think Weyes will be a fine admin. 
support,I read the opposition below but I think I'm going to side with Weyes on it. It seems a little gruff but that's what some users (newbies included) seem to understand best. He's usually pretty good at researching the situation before he jumps to a conclusion. I think the man needs a mop. 
support,I can understand if a vandal hunter becomes a bit shortheaded sometimes as the people who oppose state as reason. I assume that Weyes will learn from any mistakes he makes in that area. 
support,having read this discussion I find the supportive arguments more compelling than the opposing arguments. 
support,What Thue said. 
support,Great RC patroller. 
support,Strong I wasn't entirely sure about supporting someone who declined adminship so recently but all the right qualifications seem to be there and a look through some recent edits showed impressive results. . 
support,Edit history suggests to me he will use his admin powers responsibly. 
support,Gets my support vote. 
support,After careful consideration I see Weyes would get a lot of benefit from the admin tools and would use them for the good of Wikipedia. 
support,Please see below (in the "Neutral" section). [[Image:Bass clef2.gif|25px|Cello today?]] [[User talk:Flcelloguy|Give me a note! ]]</font color> [[File:Eighth note (crop).gif|15px|d.c. al fine?]] 
support,El C made me vote yes (see below) although I have no idea what he means by "Please reconsider your votes and very strongly oppose his nomination. By which I mean support it!" :p 
support,We need more wikijanitors especially ones that will brave external pruning. Although I'd like to see some more tempered words to newbies and probable vandals alike almost all of us are guilty of poorly choosing our words and failing to assume good faith from time to time. 
support,dedicated RC patroller any doubts I may have had have been allayed by El_C's comments below. 
support,More wielders of the mop is fine by me. 
support,Weyes' curtness towards new editors is indeed an issue and I hope that this will improve (it might be an idea to refer explicitly to the edit which is causing problems though I appreciate that this takes time) but it is not enough of a problem for me not to trust Weyes with admin privileges. His behaviour towards external links is not an issue for me. PS: My first vote on RfA prompted by Cecropia's plea. 14:18 21 Jun 2005 (UTC) <br> I have to add that I am not very happy with his comment on [[Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Quantum sort2]] though iterating that the result of the [[Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Quantum sort|previous vote]] was delete. 
support,Looking through his edits he shows an indefatigable willingness to clean up vandalism and other abuses (such as link spamming). 
support,The opposing arguments ring disturbingly hollow on all counts in my view. 
support,with reservations some of the arguments below concern me (Squeakbox's for example) but they are balanced by a lot of good work too. 
support,Active in reverting vandalism. 
support,thoroughly wondering how I missed this one earlier. 
support,Will be good. May I say also that anyone who get out the sockpuppets on the 'oppose' vote must have something going for them 
oppose,Confuses guidelines with policies mass blanked external links at [[BitTorrent]] [[IP address]] and [[Whois]] the latter 2 because I had pointed them out as 2 of the many sites containing such external links; only stopped edit warring his blanking after an admin told him to stop. This action left the sites temporarily wide open to spammers by removing the competition but he wasn't watching the sites to remove the spamming that his actions had allowed. This all occurred very recently and shows he is not ready to be an admin 
oppose,Behaviour with Ozdusters was totally out of order. Chasing off newbies who are creating content should be deprecated not rewarded even if that content is borderline. I don't think that people should be made admins just because they are willing to do RC patrol. There seems to be a feeling current that it's okay to be badly behaved so long as you're doing that whereas in truth this is the area where the best behaviour should be employed because it's so often the interface with newbies. 
oppose,Well because this just occurred a few hours ago I'd like to suggest that the interaction recorded [[User_talk:Ozdusters|here]] may not exhibit the kindness and assumption of new user good faith that we usually expect from administrators. On the other hand I assume this was mostly a miscommunication so I won't oppose just now. [[User talk:Cdc|(talk)]] 19:29 13 Jun 2005 (UTC) (See also the discussion [[WP:AN/I#Ozdusters|here]]. [[User talk:Cdc|(talk)]] 19:40 13 Jun 2005 (UTC)) Moving from neutral to oppose; I'm now persuaded that Weyes would be too sharp with goodfaith new users; several comments on [[WP:AN/I]] from others hasn't elicited any indication that Weyes recognizes s/he might have been off the mark. 
oppose,I saw him reiterating the line about how we put up with too much nonsense which sounds to me like a scary thing for an admin to say. 
oppose,I commend his vigilance however I have seen this user undo several perfectly good edits with no explanation. Also has a tendency towards antagonisation of members he disagrees with. 
oppose,What Grace Note said. 
oppose,Oppose because of strict opposition to external links. 
oppose,I've seen this editor appear on my vandal monitor far too many times to support his candidacy for adminship. People who are frequently reverted by administrators are not likely to be administrator material. 
oppose,Strong Oppose. Far too new far too abrasive. Virtually no positive article space contributions seems only interested in deleting and reverting. Anyone doing RC patrol is appreciated but any Admins doing RC patrol need to be much more diplomatic even when dealing with vandals. Treat people like dogs they act like dogs. It's a selfamplifying circuit I'd rather see in the hands of someone who wants to lower the hostility levels rather than raise them. Would also like to see much better use of edit summaries. 
oppose,on several grounds: Abrasive style frequently uninformative edit summaries and deletion of useful links. All these build a picture of questionable judgement. I have no doubt that Weyes is an asset to the project and is wellintentioned. I would expect to support a nomination after a few months of courteous interaction consistent edit summaries and more cautious link removal. Consider <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lexmark&diff=next&oldid=15471073 this edit> in which Weyes removes a link to Lexmark's company profile at Computer Business Review with the summary "rv spam". It is one of dozens of similar deletions made yesterday. I understand that CBR sells more detailed reports than those it publishes on its website (and is therefore a commercial site) but this is no different to linking to Stuff the Daily Telegraph or one of the many other publishing sites that sell subscriptions. Inappropriate deletions like this have been flagged to Weyes repeatedly. To be persisting with them after such warnings and while such behaviour is being discussed at RFA is not the behaviour that I seek of an admin.
oppose,seems a bit too abrasive. 
oppose,I agree with Theo. 
oppose,for now may support in the future. Before next nomination I'd like to see more descriptive edit summaries a user page with something meaningful and a bit more diplomacy toward newbies. 
oppose,Better to wait a while especially because we don't have any [[Wikipedia:Requests for deadminship|reliable way to revoke adminship]] in case promoting was a mistake. 
oppose,Too abrasive. 
oppose,I agree that he seems a little too abrasive. 
support,deserves the rollback button for his work on RC patrol alone. Good contributor. 
support,A good RC patroller who would benefit from the admin tools. 
support,His contributions and grunt work far outweigh the (largely removed from context) two points being brought against him. Tentatively neutral. Was there ever plain comment from Weyes himself on that "[[User talk:Ozdusters|Ozdusters]]" newbie incident? I don't like all the rhetoric from the last round's opposition but would like to know his take. 
support,(and as this is likely to get long I've added headers. I wanted to add support last time but the file was just too damn long to edit). 
support,Hope he makes it this time. Weyes deserves our support. This vote is also not a battleground for policy discussions. 
support,No undeniable evidence says that I should oppose Weyes' nomination and I have only had good experience with him in the past. He has done very good work in the WP namespace and should be given a mop and bucket to carry out this behindthescenes work. 
support,Seems to do good work. 
support,Yes there are two or ten examples of Weyes having behaved more grumpy than prefered among his thousand dealings with newbies but it's human and I think he knows when he hasn't been at his best and has learned from them. Anyway they are very few cases that don't ruin my picture of Weyes as a hardworking civil and well meaning wikiholic who would clearly benefit from having a mop. 
support,once more. 
support,Same as last time. 
support,He shows an indefatigable willingness to clean up vandalism and other abuses (such as link spamming). I note some of the worries expressed by below and I hope that Weyes will pay heed but on the whole I think that he'll make a good admin. 
support,Good RC patrol effort and mistakes made were easily fixable newbie mistakes. | [[User_talk:Linuxbeak|Talk]] | 
support,Strong just like last time. 
support,as before: Notwithstanding valid issues brought up at the previous vote I have enough trust in Weyes for him to be given admin privileges. 
support,Third time now that I've voted both for and against this candidate (shush JRM!). That actually means I voted SIX times! Which is pretty sweet if you ask me which I hope for. (still on break btw just wanted to see how his RFA was doing and to my surprise... SIX times!). 
support,extra support for fighting link spam 
support,Still as per the last RFA. 
support,again. 
support,Same as before. I should note that at the end of the 7 days last time he had right at 80% support if you disregard the sockpuppet votes so I think he should have been promoted then. 
support,As before. 
support,Again. 
support,As per previous vote. 
support,as per previous vote and note this revoting thing looks too much like [[Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/List of the Great Boners of all time|a certain VfD]]. 
support,per previous vote. | [[User talk:Flcelloguy|A note? ]]</font color>| 
support,excellent RC patroller. 
support,I trust him. 
support,Seems friendly 
support,No need to convince me this time El. 
support,still convinced he would make a fine admin. 
support,I have seen his committment to reversing vandalism in action. 
support,Wikipedia needs such active users as admins to keep the whole ship from sinking down. 
support,Simply put: I trust him. RC patrol is a hard slog and Weyes has professed his commitment to it. This should be encouraged. 
support,once again. 
support,I trust him. 
support,Knows how to deal with vandals friendly to normal users. 
support,Good chap. I can't make any sense of the opposing statements. 
oppose,As per previous vote. 
oppose,as per reasons set out in my previous vote. 
oppose,because I still do not trust this candidate's judgement despite the support now and earlier by people whose opinions I respect. I note that Weyes' edit summaries have become more explanatory and I appreciate that. I also admire the good humour which he has displayed throughout this battering process. I remain concerned however about Weyes' tendency to remove external links wholesale and the apparent lack of doubt or reconsideration when the invalidity of a link is questioned. Similarly potentially misleading oversimplification in debate worries me. All this was covered in the [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Weyes2|previous vote]] so I will not rehash details here. I still see Weyes as a valuable industrious editor but I do not feel comfortable handing the delete button to someone with these behavioural patterns. I would be happy to support a renomination after a few months of demonstrated discussion before wholesale reversions informative accurate edit summaries accurate argument and consistent courtesy.
oppose,Again. 
oppose,again. Same reasons as Theo same reasons as previous vote. I think Weyes needs more time to soften his edges and temper his judgements. 
oppose,As stated earlier. 
oppose,what Theo said. 
oppose,as per previous vote. I am very unhappy at this tactic of restarting the vote on a new page especially given that the people who voted before have not been informed. If Weyes is successful on this vote I would try and get it declared null and void. Dirty tactics and a complete farce 
oppose,Better to wait a while especially because we don't have any [[WP:RFDA|reliable way to revoke adminship]] in case promoting was a mistake. 
oppose,I just found him starting off on a IP with {{tl|test3}}. That seems a bit harsh. Just reinforces the issue with overly harsh treatment of newbies. (Also needs to learn to use subst:.) 
oppose,per Theo's arguments. 
oppose,I'm not so much against the idea of Weyes becoming an admin; I like the guy and think he'd be good at it. I'm opposed to it happening this way. makes some good points on [[Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_adminship#Weyes_extended]]. I think this whole thing is too much "let's just keep voting until it comes out our way." We should let things cool off for a month or two and then revisit the issue. 
oppose,It's funny because everybody says that adminship is "no big deal" but everyone acts like it is particularly here. The simple fact of the matter is that blocking users is a big power and not everyone should have it perhaps even (dare I say it) some of our current admins. makes some good points and I was surprised that on the original debate sockpuppets weren't just discounted and the votes tallied which would have resulted in Weyes application being rejected. I don't doubt that they (edit:the bureaucrats) acted in good faith but it casts an unneeded cloud over Weyes application nomination. I would suggest letting it cool down and coming back in a month or so. After all if it's no big deal anyway what does it matter if there's a bit of a wait? 
oppose,Too abrasive. 
oppose,This is my third oppose vote ever (as far as I can remember) but I feel the need to move on procedural grounds. I don't like the diffs that had pointed out. 
oppose,Oppose because irregularities in the vote make me wary of promoting him. 
support,I like the candidate's light hearted style and positive attitude. In this case the Agecountitis cancels out the Editcountitis. He clearly [[Grok]]s what we're all about. Does'nt seem to be an office seeker or Apratchnik but is levelheaded and has a sense of humor. True striving for the holy grail of NPOV is every good upstanding Wikipedian's duty...but so is vandal fighting. Which nearly every candidate lists as their top priority for wanting the mop when they would do just as well on this score to simply ask for the RollbackButton instead. Besides we live in an unusual world...if a horse can be a Senator then why can't EmperorNorton be an admin? 
support,good enough for an admin it's no big deal. (I like your name by the way and would NEVER vote against someone because of it).
support,I like the cut of your jib. 
support,Good name for an admin. 
oppose,Strong Oppose Given that you were just welcomed to the encyclopedia yesterday I'm afraid there isn't much reason to trust you with adminship. While Emperor Norton was a cuddly chap and Caligula is an immortal hero of dark comedy your support of these two figures isn't especially reassuring as a sign that you'll follow consensus. Edit some then come back. 
oppose,Low edit counts and low activity. (Sorry 60 edits in one year is just way too low...) 
oppose,Very low edit count with only 26 mainspace edits virtually no use of User Talk needs much more experience interacting with other users IMHO 
oppose,Low edit count and low activity 
oppose,due to this whole thing reeking of a joke. April is 5 months from now! Seriously I'm not a subscriber to editcountitis but less than 75 edits sounds WAY too low to me. 
oppose,per above. 
oppose,Clear oppose sorry. [[Image:Flag_of_Europe_and_Austria.svg|20px]] 
oppose,Get involved show us that you care. Once you do that you will get tons of support votes but not before.
oppose,Activity is to low needs more edits and experience. 
oppose,Not enough experience. No comments on talk page shows little interaction with other Wikipedians. 
oppose,Inexperienced.May the Force be with you! 
oppose,Far too few edits. 
oppose,for now. Get some more experience. 
oppose,I'm not usually an editcountitis person but <http://tools.wikimedia.de/~kate/cgibin/count_edits?dbname=enwiki&user=WhatWouldEmperorNortonDo 63> edits is too little and 16 in combined talk namespaces indicates little interaction with other Wikipedians. 
support,I'll be the first 
support,Second! 
support,I was sure he was an admin. 
support,I thought he was one already. (And no I am not part of some kind of RfA nominating scheme!) 
support,Does a lot of good work especially in CfD and TfD and having the ability to finish it off makes natural sense. With an apparently natural like of gruntwork the final link in the chain makes all good sense. 
support,Who's an admin? What's a bureaucrat? And I don't know about developers... 
support,will make a great admin and always greets new users warmly. He has also done a great job here on Wikipedia. 
support,There is not enough reason to belive that this user would not make a good admin. While I am mildly concerned about behavior regarding [[Template:Reqimage]] this is not sufficent to lose my support. 
support,Helps out tremendously on Cfd. Not concerned enough about the Template:Reqimage situation brought up below to not support: You can't not engage in conflict when dealing with certain people. 
support,I still have concerns over the [[Template:Reqimage]] fiasco but other than that does a bunch of scutwork that I doubt anyone else wants to do (mass recats for instance) and contributes usefully in the article namespace. 
support,Exactly the kind of person Wikipedia needs most to keep at least some quality. 
support,He would make an excellent admin. 
support,I have seen him do some excellent work around the Wiki and think he would benefit from admin priveleges. 
support,Most certainly. Have seen much good work. 
support,Who is a great editor and will make an even better admin. 
oppose,Too easily engages in conflict particularly on [[Template:Reqimage]] where he created an <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Reqimage&diff=15184608&oldid=14883456 awful "box" format> version of it and has been holding up people from improving it. [[Wikipedia:Ownership|Ownership]] is not a good admin quality neither are <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR&diff=19006499&oldid=19002526 3RR violations>. 
oppose,Evidently feels empowered to [[Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/3RR#User:Who|invent exceptions to the threerevert rule]] and apply them to himself. He <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Reqimage&action=history reverted> the template cited above four times in less than seven hours but claims that he for a variety of nonsensical reasons. I don't mean to discount 's contributions (which hopefully will continue irrespective of this discussion's outcome) but someone who attempts to unilaterally override official policy isn't cut out to be an admin. Also I'm rather troubled by his belief that revert warring is an appropriate way to "avoid a RV war" and his sense of entitlement to three reverts per page per day. ("The actual edit war was the last 3 edits...") 
oppose,Admins shouldn't do things that would get them blocked in any other circumstance. 
oppose,Behavior on [[Template:Reqimage]] does not augur well for this user having the keys to the janitorial closet. 21:26 17 July 2005 (UTC) addendum I haven't had a lot of interaction with Who and apart from some possible indiscretion dealing with reqimage Who seems to be a solid contributor. I well know that interacting with certain other users can be extremely aggravating and may sometimes result in less than optimal actions. If this is vote is not successful and if Who continues to show improved judgement I could easily support for adminship the next time around. 
oppose,I wanted to support him as he has for the most part been a good editor but just the facts that for one thing the Template:Reqimage situation landed him a 3RR violation and for another he's taken his conflict with and shifted it over to his RfA where they appear to be continuing to fight make me somewhat suspicious to support his adminship candidacy. 
oppose,Although I find the user to be polite and approachable  I'm rather concerned at how he was bold with a particular contentious subject (the directors TFD) without asking for a consensus first. Although being bold is usually encouraged it was in this instance poor judgement that could bias the decision of the closing admin on the TFD. More experience and I'm sure he would be OK. Too soon. 
support,DOWN WITH EDITCOUNTITIS!!! 
support,I don't see why not. Adminship should not be solely based on edit counts which happen to be a very poor indicator of activity. Adminship is simply removing some security restrictions because we know the guy is not an idiot. 
oppose,As I write only 665 edits and only 130 or so of those to Wikipedia: space with very few indeed to the various Talk: spaces. Not enough 'stuff' to judge interaction on which is important for admins. Article work appears ok but at least several of those on the user page are singlesentence stubs. Some of the others have never been edited by this username so presumably as an anon. Not really able to consider the edits as anon unfortunately since no means of attributing them. Also doesn't use edit summaries nearly enough and the answer to Question 3 "smalltime users or IPs who like to futz around" leaves me feeling very unsure. Do you mean vandals or just editors whose edits you think are "incorrect"? In any case come back in a welldistributed thousand edit summaries' time or two and I'll consider afresh. 
oppose,Good editor but too few edits. 
oppose,A bit new short on edits; was told to wait by some but decided to selfnom anyway. Voted to keep [[Coq Roq]] and then nominated [[The Subservient Chicken]] for deletion citing Coq Roq: [[WP:POINT]] confusion or just pandering? Either way oppose for now. Try again soon. 
oppose,you cannot become an administrator until you have made 1000 edits. 
oppose,700 edits in 19 months is just too few. Also needs to use edit summaries more often. </sup/><p style="fontfamily: Bradley Hand ITC Comic Sans MS;">
oppose,I'm not comfortable with the editor's grasp of Wikipedia policy based on the relatively low number of edits in the WP namespace (most of which are VfD edits). Also the lack of edit summaries is discouraging. 
oppose,Needs more experience. More edit summaries would also be helpful. 
oppose,now. Needs more experience. 
oppose,hyperbolic confrontational style demonstrated below is not productive seemingly belies his statement that he is "not one to burst out at other users." 
oppose,ABSOLUTELY NOT. Not only is this nomination in the wrong section but he has harassed me on Wikipedia and on IRC about things I didn't even do. He <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:CryptoDerk&diff=14425638&oldid=14425633 blanked my talk page> then told me he'd only stop if <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ACryptoDerk&diff=14454527&oldid=14425668 I talked to him on IRC>. (The topic he is discussing is related to when he was repeatedly quieted kicked and banned by at least 3 different ops in IRC. The specific incident he is referring to I had nothing to do with.) 
oppose,. WikiFan I'm sorry to do this to you but those links that CryptoDerk posted are rather damning. I think you need to have some more time editing and learning how to deal with stress a little better before you run for admin again. You're a good editor but you apparently need to work on getting along with others more. | [[User_talk:Linuxbeak|Talk]] | 
oppose,per CryptoDerk's comments. More experience is needed. 
support,By AGF I should assume that this user's claim as having an old abandoned account as true. 
oppose,Sorry you really need a lot more edits and you haven't really been here long enough. [[WP:ESP|e]]
oppose,Yes you need about an order of magnitude more experience. 
oppose,per and . Maybe in about four months' time. 
oppose,Its very good that you want to become an admin to help Wikipedia but Im afraid that you dont have enough experience. Please continue to be a dedicated and contientious editor and come back when you have amassed over 1000 valuable edits and have shown yourself capable of handling admin tools. Good luck. 
oppose,[[Opera|Oppose]] because of reasons given above. 
oppose,Strong Oppose and Delist too few edits 
oppose,User is on a good road to being a strong contributor. 
oppose,Sorry Wikiwoo but you have fewer edits than me & I don't have a lot. You are a great editor however but you need more edits. Re request after you have at least 2000 edits (Which is the norm for admins). 
oppose,Extreme les... sorry. too little experience as the low edit count and previous malformed nomination show. 
oppose,Without even checking how long he's been here just judging by the hard time he had getting this RfA set up properly (<http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_adminship&diff=28140412&oldid=28137609> <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship&diff=next&oldid=28140412> <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship&diff=next&oldid=28140597> <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_adminship%2FWikiwoohoo&diff=28140026&oldid=25341483> <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Wikiwoohoo&diff=next&oldid=28140026> <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Wikiwoohoo&diff=next&oldid=28140118> <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Wikiwoohoo&diff=next&oldid=28140390>) and linked to (<http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Wikiwoohoo&diff=prev&oldid=28142668> <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Wikiwoohoo&diff=next&oldid=28142668> and still wrong!) leads me to the conclusion that he's still not ready. I did not oppose Wikiwoohoo's previous nomination but the dismissive way in which he refers to those who did (<http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_adminship&diff=prev&oldid=28141887>) is a red flag. "Agecountis"?! Ten respectable Wikipedians opposed Wikiwoohoo for very valid reasons. At the very least he should treat them and their opinion with civility. 
oppose,too soon after previous nomination. No evidence of having addressed or ameliorated the issues presented there. 
oppose,OwenX summed it up. Selfnoms are usually a warning sign. 
oppose,lack of experience. First edit to an article (and fourth overall) was a month and a half ago on [[25 September]]. Has only 163 total edits to articles (fewer than 500 overall) almost entirely focused on a very narrow range of subjects. Many of these may not be marked as minor but still are not terribly substantial. No particular editcounting or account age standard is required to tell that this user isn't nearly ready. 
oppose,needs more time and experience. 
oppose,Oppose. Not ready yet. I also note that people declaring "agecountitis" fail to mention that editing time standards have actually been dropping. While it was once rare (not too long ago) to see a user promoted to admin after only three months of editing that happens quite often now. 
oppose,more time needed. 
oppose,At least one more month of work should be sufficient. 
oppose,Weak Oppose needs more time and experience. But let's not pile it on okay?
support,Without a doubt. 
support,He wasn't perfect in the dispute but everything I read that he wrote showed that he was editing in the best of faith and putting up with a lot of abuse for it. 
support,I agree with Taxman but noone's perfect in a dispute (I'm certainly not). 
support,I trust Ed Poor will also cast a positive vote despite his differences. After all "it's no big deal". 
support,He has made a strong contribution to Wikipedia. He is evenhanded and aware of his own POV invaluable qualities in an admin. 
support,Absolutely 
support,I've admired his work for a while now and I think he'd be an excellent admin. 
support,His contributions speak for themselves and while he can get heated when dealing with the POV pushers on climate change articles that demonstrates his humanity and I for one think 'there but for the grace of god go I'. 
support,His "faults" seem only normal to me and I think he edits in good faith and would not do anything but good with administrator abilities. 
support,Read userpage RfA RfC. A user who has had problems in controversial subjects he actually knows about and tends to draw...um...[[kooks|alternative viewpoints]]. Seems logical and recognizes adminship requires him to be restrained in these areas. 
support,I shall support. 
support,! William is a scientist and a strong defender of a group of controversial science topics that have been under attack by POV pushing skeptics and pseudoscience believers. Wikipedia needs more expert editors and administrators who understand science. Given that he also understands that admin.powers are not to be used to win arguements and disputes as he noted below. 
support,support with my thanks for putting up with WP great and tedious as it is. 
support,Seems like a fine user. Also I cannot see how the [[William Connolley]] article can be described as a vanity page. 
support,I am utterly amazed that defending the consensus on climate change is grounds for opposing him. 
support,Avoiding conflict when dealing with a topic like global warming over a long period of time is almost impossible so that there have been some conflicts should not in itself be a criterion of exclusion. Conflict avoidance is a valid strategy but if all good users avoided conflicts then any aggressive user who wants to promote a certain ideology could easily do so. I don't believe William is likely to abuse his sysop privileges (nor that if he did it would actually help him) I do think he now understands and will try to follow 3RR and I get the impression that his behavior is generally reasonable and sane if perhaps a bit confrontational. I do believe William genuinely understands his edits to be a valid interpretation of NPOV policy particularly the section on pseudoscience with its remarks on proportional representation and clear attribution. I don't think a disagreement among reasonable people over what is and isn't NPOV can or should be grounds for denying adminship. I will apply the same standard to people from the opposite point of view of course. I will reconsider my vote if someone shows me recent abusive comments or edits which are otherwise in clear violation of policy.
support,Moved from neutral to support. 
support,Wikipedia is a learning process for all of us and it'll likely be helpful to have one more admin who can recognize a pseudoscience on sight (even if a couple of months ago I did walk away from a conversation with a UN specialist on global warming that left me rather less convinced they've shown a correlation... although CO2 emissions should be cut anyway IMO). 
support,To paraphrase previous voters: NPOV does not mean all POVs should necessarily be given equal time and William has done a good job of keeping our climate articles grounded in reason. Furthermore I have absolutely no cause to believe he would abuse his admin powers. 
support,Cool. 9 July 2005 10:19 (UTC). To elaborate further I agree with Eloquence. 
support,Looking at the evidence here and in the RFC and RFAr he does sometimes get overheated but not unacceptably so as far as I have seen. I also did not find him pushing his POV too much noting that on a scientific issue the opinion of the majority of scientists should be given prominence. I trust he'll not use his admin privileges to settle wars on climate change. 
support,although somewhat hesitantly. Whilst I support his contributions and efforts I fear that his having sysop abilities would generate antipathy and unwarranted controversy and perhaps even lead to his downfall which would be most unfortunate. However I'm willing to take a chance.[[Image:Flag_of_Australia.svg|15px]] 
support,Simply I trust him. 
support,A polite editor who continues to make good use of edit summaries and respects the 3RR. I don't there will be abuse in any case. 
support,Carbonite's point above doesn't sway me because on a couple of occasions Connolley was consciously trying to avoid the 3RR. Some of the reasons given below for opposing his candidacy well they either puzzle or disappoint me. That some may consider his userpage a "vanity" page is just silly. People put all sorts of things on their user pages and shouldn't be limited to pictures of dogs and quotes from Hermann Hesse or Buckminster Fuller. More importantly Connolley did not come to Wikipedia in order to promote himself (e.g. through his user page); he has been an active contributor to articles covering topics he has knowledge of. Isn't this the character of the ideal wikipedian? Has he been in editdisputes? How many people here have not? I actually think there is something at stake here. We all want wikipedia to be open to all users meaning one need not have a PhD. in anthropology to write on an anthropological topic. No one has ever disputed this. But some people interpret this to mean that people who actually have demonstrable knowledge of an area should somehow be penalized for contributing to Wikipedia. My vote is not only for Connolley it is against those people who hate having their cherished views challenged by someone who knows more than they do. 
support,even without answer to question below. Real academic expertise here needs to be encouraged. It is all to easy to wonder why we are bothering to argue with the ignorant over issues of fact (as opposed to opinion). 
support,He's trying to uphold encyclopedic standards. That's bound to lead to conflict sadly. 
support,yep i'm not sure why his scientific expertise is relevant to adminship though we desperately need more editors like that. however i do agree with slim that the conflicts on the climate change articles should not be held against him. i support since he seems to me a mature & trustworthy editor who will use adminship judiciously. 
support,As with many expert editors WMC showed less patience that many would like but has over time raised the quality of articles and participation. The "One Revert" agreement which he participates in is an example of the kind of creative use of wiki methods to produce better articles. 
support,Good contributor. 
support,A long history of conflict but that's regrettably inevitable when one works in a controversial area. 
support,It's a great plus having expert contributors not to say that experts are necessarily always correct but certainly it raises the level of content and discussion in the areas of contribution. Since William M. Connolley's edits demonstrate collaboration with other editors even in contentious areas I feel confident he'll be a good admin. 
support,it's a big advantage for an admin to have experience of editing in highconflict areas and to have shown that he can stand the heat. I've held off voting for a few days to see if anybody's going to provide diffs showing actual examples of any the accusations made against the candidate but it's not looking like it. 
support,I don't believe he was completely cool under fire but then again he was getting a hell of lot of it whilst trying to uphold standards. 
support,As a scientist who years ago retreated from the newsgroup sci.environment under the increasingly shrill barrage of antiintellectual junk from both flanks of the greenhouse debate I always admired WMC for being one of a tiny handful who calmly hung in there and presented the scientific perspective. sci.env became unreadable and it is largely to WMC's credit that the same has not happened to the climaterelated pages here. That he has attracted conflict is no great surprise rather it is impressive that so little of it has followed him here. 
support,He can handle it. 
support,Levelheaded and a staunch voice for science as opposed to pseudoscientific claims. 
support,Rightwing pseudoscience needs to be checked; we're not a conduit for corporate climate lobbyism. 
support,Absolutely 
support,A knowledgeable effective contributor who'd be an asset with the tools. 
support,Wikipedia needs such knowledgeable people not only as editors but to perform admin functions as well.
support,G8 was listening world. 
support,Changing my vote. 
support,Anyone who has the experience and knowledge to spot pseudoscience absolutely needs the mop and bucket. It only adds to Wikipedia's credibility. 
support,Unflinching commitment to protecting the accuracy of controversial scientific articles is exactly what we should be looking for in administrators. 
support,deserves community recognition for editing in the teeth of silly attitudes and the worst thing I know about him is thaty he once said I played [[go (game)|go]] like a Pascal programmer. 
support,commendable work attempting to maintain NPOV on climate change and global warming articles. If we oppose nomination for bias then we should similarly remove adminship from a variety of admins. 
support,Handy guy I must say. 
support,WMC is an intelligent guy who will not I'm sure abuse admin powers. 
support,one of the most knowledgeable Wikipedians I know 
oppose,I oppose on the basis that I do not feel that he has demonstrated extremely poor [[Wikipedia:Etiquette|Wikiquette]] with regard to his [[vanity page]] at [[William Connolley]] created by in order to further their position (which I nevertheless agree wholehearted with) on [[global environment change]]. 
oppose,because he allows his POV to damage Wikipedia. There will be fewer limits on his behavior as a minimum on his shown reversion behavior.<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Climate_change_dispute#Temporary_injunction> He deletes material which conflicts with his beliefs and participates in ad hominem attacks. <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/William_M._Connolley#Statement_of_the_dispute> <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/William_M._Connolley#Statement_of_the_dispute> As he mentioned he is currently slashing [[Global warming]] and removing material which contradicts his beliefs. For example over an hour ago he cut two paragraphs about problems computer simulations with an edit comment "Climate models (potentially controversial) remove two paras on the grounds that solar and clouds are already mentioned and detail is not needed here should be in GCM article."<http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Global_warming&curid=12399&diff=18347649&oldid=18347434> but he failed to move the paragraphs to the GCM article.<http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Global_climate_model&diff=18352003&oldid=16051489> He has used the same burninsteadofmove method before. (
oppose,I agree with many of Ed Poor's points <Note: now in the neutral section below>. In short although I think WMC is an excellent editor there's far too much conflict surrounding him. Looking over his recent contributions there are numerous reverts accusations of POV or "junk science" and rather snide edit summaries. 
oppose,Strong oppose. WMC is rude condescending shows no respect for NPOV and has demonstrated no desire or ability to cooperate with others to build a neutral encyclopedia reflecting various perspectives. He is one of the worst candidates I could imagine for adminship. He is already on a revert parole (a fairly mild treatment considering the events) for these behaviors and you want to give him adminship? > 
oppose,Oppose does not support NPOV. 
oppose,Let's wait a [[Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Climate change dispute#William M. Connolley: Sixmonth revert parole on certain articles|few months]]. 
oppose,Too many issues. POV warring on Climate Change and antiTesla bais over at [[Nikola Tesla]]. I'm sure WMC is a good editor otherwise but why does he need admin powers? 
oppose,edits too much in the area in which he is professionally involved i.e. issues around original research. If most of his substantial editing was in neutrally reporting/expounding the views of people other than himself as to what matters are on subjects other than the ones in which he has a professional/ideological involvement I would have no objection. 
oppose,unless I misunderstand his RfAr finished about 23 weeks ago and resulted in parole which period has barely begun. Given the amount of thunder and lightning surrounding the user at present I think perhaps try again after the effects of teh RfAr have died away and there's been a period of reasonably equanimous interactions. 
oppose,Still under penalty from the ArbCom. May support once the revert parole ends. 
oppose,No way should an editor who had to be put under revert parole be given the capability to roll back edits no matter what he promises. If he had shown the good faith then that it requires to believe him now he never would have needed the censure in the first place. Among other reasons as stated. 
oppose,The right thing to do while under revert parole would have been to decline the nomination and ask the nominator to consider it again later. Accepting the nomination shows unwillingness to put one's own interests aside temporarily for the greater good of the project or oversight of a greater obligation that should be obvious to admin candidates. This is further evidenced by the fact that the RfAr case was primarily about revert warring. Had this been an RfC I would not feel so strongly about it because any two editors could then filibuster any potential administrator candidate. But since RfAr cases are much more rare and accepted RfAr cases are even more rare the correct path was to decline the nomination. We cannot demand that admins hold themselves to a higher standard of conduct than the general editing public but I will certainly request them to do so. 
oppose,Needs to show more balance. 
oppose,If he applies to the ArbCom to have his revertingrigths restored I will consider (and probably do) support but giving rollback to a guy under revertingparole.....well....doesn't matter how great a user he is that just doesn't sit right with me. 
oppose,WMC certainly looks like a knowledgeable contributor in the area that he edits but his censure by the Arbcom can't be ignored at this time. His defense on the arbitration page was to go to his credentials which though they may uphold the veracity of his edits do not excuse his violation of revert rules and disregard for wiki procedures. 
oppose,I know nothing about this editor's history as we never frequent the same articles and I havn't been doing RC patrol recently and never ran into him there. I understand however that he is under ArbCom sanction at the moment so I am forced to vote oppose I cannot in good concience allow someone currently under sanction to gain adminship.
oppose,I have no particular axe to grind with him on global warming but I had the unpleasant experience of being involved in a reversion war with him on what would normally be a relatively dry noncontroversial topic: the [[Roche Limit]]. He violated the [[Wikipedia:Threerevert_rule]] by readding the word "orbiting" to a figure on the Roche Limit page four times in one 24hour period at 21:53 2 September 2004 22:10 2 September 2004 08:46 3 September 2004 and 16:50 3 September 2004. I followed the 3RR and waited posting to discussion before reverting a fourth time at 02:04 5 September 2004. A third party requested that we both stop the revert war at 02:27 5 September 2004. William M. Connolley then ignored this request and reverted a fifth time at 09:40 5 September 2004. Rather than defend his view in talk thereafter as would be appropriate under the circumstances he simply stopped responding on the talk page after a web reference to the original source was found and quoted on the archived discussion page at 16:56 8 September 2004. Both the page and the talk page were dormant after my post to the talk page from 9 September to 12 October 2004 in spite of the assurance that the dispute would be resolved in discussion much to my frustration. As (unlike him) I honored the cease reversion request the page was to his liking and so he felt no need to justify his actions on the talk page. He violated the 3RR rule then he violated a cease reversion request and he didn't even bother to respond on talk about the subject. I do not think that someone who behaves in that manner is an appropriate choice for an administrator role. Preceding [[Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by 
oppose,I do not believe that it would be right for someone who is under probation to become a sysop. 
oppose,I've never had any contact with this user but since he's had an RfAr against him and gotten revert parole and a lot of his edits are tied to his work allowing him to be an admin is asking for trouble. 
oppose,I don't like the idea of someone on probation becoming an admin. After the probation period is up I would consider lending my support. 
oppose,That's so not hot. 
oppose,I'm not in favor of giving the rollback button to someone who is still under Arbcom censure for having engaged in edit wars and inappropriate reverts. Once the parole is up or Arbcom lifts the parole I'll reconsider. 
oppose,Being an 'active' contributor I would see possible conflicts of interest if he would be an admin too. 
oppose,user is on probation. 
oppose,Acts too controversially to be given admin powers.
oppose,evidently has issues with Wikipedia policy which is not a good quality for an Administrator.
support,I like him
oppose,Strongly oppose at this stage. 
oppose,1400 edits sparse use of edit summaries. Some strange edits like saying in an article that something was "really cool" redirecting the Angela article to User:Angela (deleted now and replaced so it's not in the history). That "Onefool" business is a bit weird too. 
oppose,His edits to this page alone do not fill me with confidence about his potential ability to be an effective admin let alone some of contributions and the Onefool thing. 
oppose,Hasn't really made the case for becoming an admin and has exhibited some bizarre behavior on occasion so I oppose at this time. 
oppose,Wonderfool I don't feel you're ready yet. Try again in about six months and use that time to prove your mettle. 
oppose,Oppose for all the reasons above. 
oppose,Oppose for all reasons mentioned. 
oppose,Oppose. Come back later please. 
oppose,Oppose for all reasons above. 
oppose,Oppose for all reasons above. 
oppose,Oppose. Why? The others have said it all. I think you have to hang around for a while and take on the Wiki"culture" to a much greater extent than you appear to have done. I'll be prepared to support you later if you make progress. 
oppose,Cya later...
oppose,if a little reluctantly. Your nomination both the opening text and the questions have failed to impress me in any manner. 
oppose,more time more work etc. Just work on it stay around. 
oppose,I'd like to see more consistent participation and more edit summaries (you really don't use them often). Less than 1000 edits is quite low given how long your account has been registered. You do seem like a good editor though; with a few more months of consistent good work I will probably support your next nomination. 
oppose,Needs more experience. 
oppose,Strong Oppose Besides the lack of experience user's nomination statement is well very bad. Please take the time to say something about yourself and why you want the job. I know that's what the questions are for but I consider the nomination "This is me" to be flippant and that is a bad quality in admin. Next time put a little more thought into this. 
oppose,not enough edits. 
oppose,Way too low an edit count 1) for us to make an accurate judgement on their suitability for adminship and 2) for YHoshua to have the knowledge of the ins and outs of the Wikipedia that an admin needs. 
oppose,i've recently been making a few contributions and have been surprised at both his lack of people skills and at times his editorial judgement. he also demonstrates an authoritarian style that would not be well suited for a collaborative environment such as wikipedia. 
oppose,A few more months a couple hundred more edits and a mission statement explaining your desire for adminship and I'll change to support. 
oppose,Seems like you want to be an admin "just because." 
oppose,Oppose. I'm sure this user's great but such a lacksiedaisical selfnom isn't a good teaser of what we could expect from this contributor. 
support,my comments above. 
support,please promise me that you will get more "involved". While you have over 5000 edits you have only edited about 500 distinct pages. What made me support however was that you had over 200 edits in Wikipedia namespace; that shows you participate in VFDs etc. </sup/><p style="fontfamily: Bradley Hand ITC Comic Sans MS;">
support,With over 5000 edits? 
support,Please use edit summaries more often though . Great candidate. 
support,Over the years he has demonstrated an enthusiastic effort to ensure open religious views and a continuous requirement for clarity. While he tends to be very agressive his position has always been clear. An excellent candidate.
support,Zappaz has demonstrated an admirable level of restrain in dealing with a barrage of personal attacks and frivolous complaints that are most likely to be politically motivated than anything else. In my interactions with him I found Zappaz to be one of those editors that actually researches a subject before editing with a passion for providing copious and solid sources for his edits. If more editors had that passion Wikipedia would be a better encyclopedia. I would like to express my concern about a voting process in which editors votes are not based on the capabilities of a nominee to becoming a good Administrator but on the voter's antagonistic POV: this seems to be a perverse exercise of "revenge" against a nominee who has created and contributed to countless articles and discussions. We need more editors involved in helping with controversial articles not less. Let's not penalize Zappaz for his involvement in controversial articles. 
support,and kudos to jossi for the thoughtful nomination. Zappaz stands firmly for NPOV in the face of untiring abuse by <http://www.google.com/search?q=Andries+Krugers+Dagneaux+wikipedia&num=100&hl=en&lr=lang_en&c2coff=1&safe=off&as_qdr=all&filter=0 Andries Dagneaux> who shamlessly abuses Wikipedia as an outlet for his antireligious activism. 
support,I've read through all the opposing comments so far and read through the articles where Zappaz has been involved in controversy and have found no reason to oppose his adminship. 
support,I'll echo what I said below on dave souza's nomination: Adminship is about wearing a hat. It is a fundamentally different activity from editing. One should support or oppose an admin not based on "does this potential admin hold opinions that differ from mine" but "will this admin abuse his extra buttons or use them responsibly?" I see nothing to indicate that Zappaz will abuse admin powers. If the test for becoming an admin morphs into a vote on editorial position then we are shooting ourselves in the foot and losing a lot of potentially excellent admins. 
support,While hesitant due to some of the concerns brought by the opposition as well as some of the support votes (new user directly above for ex.) not to mention that I want more antireligious bias not less(!) still somehow I support. 
support,I support without reservation the appointment of ZappaZ to admin. I have seen his careful edits precise use of language and a clear understang of the pitfalls that collaborative projects require. He seems to have a high degree of tolerance in dealing with somewhat obsessed agendadriven people no small feat. I strongly urge his support. 
support,In fact I dedicated 15 min of our wikitime to have an idea about you and your nomination. I'm happy that I haven't wasted any of that WT. You deserve an Admin seat as long as your interests are of ancient nature (few people are interested in that). Please remember I voted positive in order to push you to contribute more than using your admin powers ;). One pertinent advice; promise yourself to correct some of behaviours noted by some our wikipedians below. Good luck. 
oppose,behavior on [[List of people who have said that they are gods]] was unnaceptable all around. [[User talk:Hipocrite|&laquo;Talk&raquo;]] 05:00 9 September 2005 (UTC). I'd like to add that I am reasonably uncomfortable with the behavior of some of my coopposers. The scattershot commenting on this RFA all over is totally uncalled for. The attacks on this individuals motives are totally uncalled for. The poor behavior of others does not address my serious concerns about attention to detail and keeping a level head. [[User talk:Hipocrite|&laquo;Talk&raquo;]] 20:01 9 September 2005 (UTC). Additionally I swear before someone that I've never heard of Prem Rawat before this RFA. 
oppose,Zappaz has no sense fairness and uses double standards when pushing his POV that I consider extreme. I have been in constant disagreement and conflict with him since he entered Wikipedia on a number of articles including [[Prem Rawat]] [[Criticism of Prem Rawat]] (on the list of most edited articles) [[guru]] [[postcult trauma]] [[apostasy]] and more. And it is not because I am a narrowminded anticult activist: user Ed Poor who is a Unificationist wrote that I am knowledgeable and fair about New religious movements. I disagree with Jossi: criticism of gurus cults new and alternative religion has very little to do with freedom of religion or lack of tolerance. And besides since when is the stated aim of Wikipedia to promote religious tolerance? I will soon compile a long list of inappropriate biased or erroneous comments and edits by Zappaz. 
oppose,i have seen Zappaz as extremly double standard when envolved in controversial topics.
oppose,Strong oppose: Zappaz has been put on the administrator's noticeboard for violating 3RR and uses double standards when involved in disputes. 
oppose,Strong oppose: When Zappaz first appeared as an editor of the Prem Rawat articles I did a search of Wikipedia to determine what other articles he had been involved in and there were almost no nonRawat articles and yet he was clearly an experienced Wikieditor. It has been suggested that 'Zappaz' is a new identity of an existing editor created especially for his proRawat work. It has also been suggested that Zappaz has been paid by the Rawat cult for this work. I would just like to add that if these allegations are true then Zappaz has earned every penny as his dedication to portraying this cult leader in a positive manner is a credit to his professionalism. 
oppose,Strongest possible oppose! Zappaz has shown over and over basic untrustworthiness I would point you at the sordid fiasco of [[Hate groups and new religious movements]] for perhaps the prime example. Zappaz kept trying to insert into [[Hate group]] the fact that [[Elan Vital]] claims the former members it calls "expremies" are a hate group. Other editors such as myself believe the material should be removed because nothing about that fact really illuminates the subject of hate groups in general. At one point in the editing Zappaz finds himself at his limit of three reverts: <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hate_group&diff=8405205&oldid=8402318> <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hate_group&diff=8406184&oldid=8406081> <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hate_group&diff=8406726&oldid=8406713>. So what does he do? Does he respect the spirit as well as the letter of the threerevert rule? No with his very next edit he <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hate_group&diff=8408001&oldid=8406847 creates a new article on the spot> starting it with a cutandpaste of <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hate_groups_and_new_religious_movements&direction=prev&oldid=8406786 his preferred version> of the section under dispute. Do we really need an editor who will look for new sneakier ways to game the system? For a further illustration of why this editor cannot be trusted read the arguments he made during the above revert war that "if any other organization controversial or not (church NRM group etc.) makes a substantial point of calling another organization or group a "hate group" and publish that in their literature then definitively it should be mentioned in this article as well" and compare with his comments in a recent <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/List_of_purported_cults/2&diff=prev&oldid=19438243 VfD> about how a list article is too POV and deserves deletion because the items of the list are "a one sided POV expressed". If you find yourself tempted to vote for Zappaz because at one point you saw him (supposedly) disregarding POV to act on principle take a closer look at his history and you'll probably see him upholding the opposite principle when that's what suits his ends. Wikipedia needs admins with integrity enough not to abuse their power. For that reason it doesn't need Zappaz as an admin. 
oppose,as above. 
oppose,Oppose for now. I have been a Wiki editor for approximately 3 years and was also once (20+ years ago) a student of user Zappaz's current spiritual teacher Prem Rawat. Also I was the original founder of the organization expremies.org towards which Zappaz appears to be most animately opposed but which I have not been active in for approximately 10 years. Zappaz's very first articletext edit shows him deleting a critical link to his spiritual teacher at <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Prem_Rawat&diff=prev&oldid=4524031 Zappaz's first articletext edit>. For this deletion his only editorial explanation was: Maharaji in the Press rv not relevant to section. The section that the link appeared in was the external links section. Does this mean that to Zappaz any criticism of his spiritual teacher is inappropriate? This does not seem to me to be consistent with Wiki NPOV policy. In Zappaz's last major articletext edit again he did not appear to be following standard Wiki policy. This was <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Criticism_of_Prem_Rawat&diff=22782383&oldid=22747336 Zappaz's last major articletext edit on 09/07>. In this major edit he inserted reams of undocumented assertions presenting all of these as fact all apparently aimed at undermining any potential criticism of Prem Rawat. In this edit he also again erased critical external links such as the link: <http://www.geocities.com/maharajiwd/ Gateway webpage> explaining this deletion with the cryptic comment mv to refs. All of these edits seem to me to show that Zappaz somehow places the priority of his need to defend the reputation of Prem Rawat over the need to let the simple facts plainly speak for themselves. When Zappaz demonstrates the understanding that in Wiki facts should always be allowed to speak more loudly than personal agendas consistently demonstrating this over a significant period of time then I will gladly support his nomination if asked but not sooner. 
oppose,I have the impression that ZappaZ does not always recognize his own bias (though he honestly tries to). Also there have been several instances where ZappaZ made a revert (and even a repeated revert) instead of discussing the matter and where ZappaZ did go against consensus of other editors. I do think that ZappaZ works at improving himself but from an administrator I'd expect above average abilities in interaction with other users and that's not (yet) the case with ZappaZ which is also visible in some of his reactions on the votes here. 
oppose,While I didn't have any personal dispute with him yet I noticed his activities in the [[Rick Ross]] discussion page. The thought that he would be an admin and thus have more control on these areas (where I also edit) is scary to me.
oppose,Strong oppose. Completely throwing away all of the other reasons not to support you have attacked in one way or another at least three of the oppose votes against him. I don't really care if you're a Wiccan a Scientologist a member of Heaven's Gate a murderer or Richard Simmons. The question is do I think that I can trust you with the administrative tools? At this point I can't. 
oppose,Oppose I'm afraid. It was going to be "neutral" but his reaction to "oppose" votes on this RFA is itself enough reason to seriously doubt about his ability to keep a cool head in controversial circumstances. (For a comparison I'm thinking of the RFA for Tony Sidaway who is highly opinionated and happy to wade into controversy but he took on board "oppose" criticisms so well that he converted many to "support" over the course of the seven days.) Six to twelve months down the track maybe? 
oppose,Oppose as per David. 
support,Strong as nominator. 
support,Puts great effort in to wikipedia articles. 
oppose,Seems to have issues with civility and little concern for copyright issues both of which are necessities for a Wikipedia admin.
oppose,Neutral candidate makes very sparse use of edit summaries. 22:52 26 October 2005 (UTC) it bothers me that the editor can't even use wiki code properly. Definitely needs more experience. 
oppose,While the comments by the nominee here might not strictly violate [[WP:NPA]] they do violate the spirit of [[WP:CIVIL]]. I don't think this editor is ready for adminship. 
oppose,Absolutely not. I don't like seeing the candidate being uncivil on his own RFA. 
oppose,I have a lot of respect for Zereshk and his many excellent contributions but I am seriously dismayed both by his repeated copyright violations and his complete lack of insight into the inappropriateness of these. Indeed instead of dealing with the fallout he has tended to shoot the messenger. Unless there is a serious change in attitude and behaviour I feel he should not be an admin. 
support,Not a vandal+reasonable knowledge of policy+good faith+reasonable civility=my support. 
support,What Y0u said. Should use edit summeries (PLEASE DO THIS... most of yours (actually all I saw) were EMPTY which forces you to look at the diffs even on simple edits which is annoying) and maybe use the preview button a bit more but the latter does not appear to be as much as a problem as Pavel indicates... maybe he could cut the post count down by 1/2 if he did (for the record I sometimes do the same thing although there is a difference between that and deciding to add stuff later too). Also the claim about VfD seems dubious as I don't find that much in its history but that hardly concerns me... 
support,I changed my mind. I think that you will be a good admin. Really it should be no big deal. You're a solid contributer. I'm sure you'll learn as you use more of your admin powers.
support,Edit summaries are commonly used by vandals to try to disguise malicious edits so they're not foolproof. 
support,I have had only positive experiences with Zxcvbnm and I am confident in his leadership 
oppose,should you be using preview button number of your edits could be easily reduced to 1/10. Majority of your edits are related to scifi+games; I see only little participation on VfD reverting and other admin associated activities. There's not much of communication with other users. You do not use edit summaries making it harder to people on RC. That said I didn't find any edit of yours being questionable. 
oppose,I largely agree with . The claim in the opening statement about VfD work is true enough but only really applies to the last 7 days before that I don't see much work there at all. There appears to be none in TfD/CfD and I presume only incidental reverting (though without edit summaries it is hard to tell). Editcountitis is not too important but there are an awful lot of savewithoutpreview edits so I have to wonder about how carefully things are checked before pressing the button which is important in an admin. I don't fully understand the additional claim in this regard in the extended opening statement is this a widespread problem? 
oppose,Oppose I observe little interaction with other people in the course of Zxcvbnm's contributions and some of what I see leaves me concerned about whether certain principles about Wikipedia have been absorbed. I don't normally care about edit counts but the inflated number here suggests to me that perhaps more experience would be appropriate. 
oppose,Blanks talk page doesn't use edit summaries and most importantly tried to pull a fast one by stating that the nomination would end August 8 1508. 
oppose,weak oppose we're not desperate for admins and I would prefer Zxcvbnm to take some time to consider the issues brought up here. I will certainly reconsider should he reapply in a month or so. 
oppose,Strong oppose because of his reactions below. Although it is unrelated to my vote I must point out that I strongly object to my actions being quoted out of context here as an example of how not to do things. 
oppose,Per Splash Pavel and Michael Snow. The response to Radiant does not leave me feeling convinced on [[wikipedia:civility|civility]]. 
oppose,as per and .
oppose,Talk page goes back only one month which gives us little interaction to look at. May support a future nomination if talk page has been archived and if edit summaries are used more in article space edits. 
oppose,is a good editor but I don't think adminship is appropriate for him at least not now. Would support user in future if 1) learned to interact more civilly with other users 2) archived rather than blanked talk pages and 3) used edit summaries consistently. See my comments below. 
oppose,doesn't have the temperament to be an admin
oppose,I don't feel he is civil enough. I would support in the future if they were a little more civil. 
oppose,I still think that more experience is required. Zxcvbnm seems to be a very good contributor but needs to take more time to learn procedures. For example even with some advice it took 13 edits to add this RfA. Also the last RfA ended only a few weeks ago. Will likely support in the future. 
oppose,His handling of the previous nomination was not impressive and is still quite recent. Seems overeager for adminship which suggests a misunderstanding of what it means; it's a few additional technical/housekeeping functions not a trophy. I'm happy to assume good faith but that's not the same as having earned my trust which is the standard for adminship. 
oppose,Has not yet addressed issues raised in his last adminship such as consistently using edit summaries and he still seems to take an inordinate amount of edits to make minor changes to an article. I will reconsider in the future but his last nomination is still too recent.
oppose,His last nomination is indeed to recent. 
oppose,at the time of his last nomination he had a problem with civility. That was only a month ago and I haven't seen evidence of improvement yet. 
oppose,Hasn't made that much improvement since last time. Too early to submit a renom. 
oppose,Strong Oppose You've shown no improvement since your last nomination. You still blank your talk page. And this line is extremely shady: "and if i am elected I will use edit summaries on every edit." If elected? Elections are for arbitrators not admins. Plus you shouldn't wait until you have sysop rights to start using edit summaries. [[User Talk:Acetic Acid|Acetic]]
oppose,Problems from previous nom do not seem to have been addressed. 
oppose,Not so soon after last time. 
oppose,No email ID too. 
oppose,Unspellable unpronounceable username makes it hard to remember his identity. Promises to change after getting sysop rights is ridiculous: should build up a track record first. 
oppose,as per Uncle Ed Poor. Let me know when you're on RFA again and I'll seriously reconsider if you use edit summaries. 
support,The above and your talk pages are convincing. Hope you don't abuse admin powers.
support,with pleasure. 
support,But for the record let me state my disagreement for selfnomination. That aside I see nothing but good things coming from Zzyzx11.oo64eva (AJ) (
support,lot of admin work and that's what matters now most. The <nowiki>{{...}}</nowiki> tags were on really bad pages. (I can be convinced otherwise seeing such tag on fully developed and reasonable page.) Preview button should be tried from time to time there's nothing wrong with it. Bit longer time on Wikipedia would be better for selfnominee. (I see 2005/February/02 did you use anonymous IP before?) 
support,I thought he was already an admin. I've seen him a lot doing helpful things.
support,I thought you were one! 
support,Zzyzx has taken it upon himself to do the dirty seamy work of reverting vandals warning them of their behavior and voting on VfD on a regular basis. He has more than earned the right to revert the tide of booshwah in a direct fashion. 
support,I've been impressed with Zzyzx's work as an editor and as a janitor.
support,A good janitor. 
support,Although I am concerned with Zzyzx11's sometimes overzealousness in regards to deletions I think that Zzyzx11 would make a useful admin. I hope that Zzyzx11 takes seriously the reasons people oppose this nomination and I hope that Zzyzx11 can change his/her behavior accordingly. 
support,Good janitorial work and although I usually oppose deletionism Zzyzx11 is level headed and sensible in discussions. 
support,I thought Zzyzx11 was already an admin to be honest. Good janitor has helped to rescue a number of pages that were borderline on VfD. 
oppose,I note Tony's concerns. They worry me enough to oppose this user. I don't think it's a good idea to give the ability to delete to an editor who is so keen to rid the encyclopaedia of protista. I very much oppose the notion of "notability" as something we should subjectively decide particularly when it is doubtless true for each of us that our ignorance far exceeds our knowledge (a reason we do this together and don't each write our own ;)).
oppose,Needs more time. 
oppose,I may support on a later occasion but I'd feel worried about having admins who make a habit of popping a <nowiki>{{explainsignificance}}</nowiki> and whatnot on articles about world famous viola players great entomologists and the like and then list them for deletion if nobody complies within a couple of weeks. Putting <nowiki>{{movetowiktionary}}</nowiki> tags on an article about a whole phylum of protista also betrays a basic ignorance that worries me. This user should acquire and demonstrate more discrimination and a greater willingness to do basic research for himself rather than sticking "not known at this address" labels on everything he doesn't happen to recognise in this our vast Library of Babel. 
oppose,Maybe next time.
oppose,I have the same worries about his attitudes to deletion as those above. As with other voters I might well vote 'support' in a month or so if there's improvement on this. 
support,Seems coolheaded (would you expect otherwise from someone from Iceland?) 
support,good choice. 
support,Ævar Arnfjörð Bjarmason (gotta love the name) has been around since February is approaching 1000 edits and is an active member of the Wikipedia community. I think he would make a fine admin. (taken from nominating statement 
support,Assuming that Ævar son of Bjarmi is not related to Halfdan the Halftroll by way of Erik Njorl son of Frothgar... 
support,A user who receives support from Wik something seen on this page about as frequently as [[Invisible Pink Unicorn|the deity Ævar worships]] has probably the most ringing endorsement one could possibly get. In fact the sense of humor rather makes me wonder what impersonator got a hold of Wik's password. Anyway I find nothing wrong and the shortage of substantive edits is compensated for by the work on images. 
support,firmly. 
support,Cool coolheaded nice [[insanity|hair_=)]] 
support,I suppose you'll tell me he wasn't one already. 
support,Agree with John. Also no big deal if he hasn't done a lot of content writing as long as he's trustworthy and wants to pitch in on site maintainance. 
support,Notwithstanding 5/t typing errors. 
support,Good image work. 
oppose,I'd want to see more substantive edits. 
oppose,Have to agree with Charles Matthews. Has about 800 edits but not enough breadth for me. About 100 of these concern [[Little Belt Bridge (1935)|Little Belt bridge]] about 50 [[Flag of Iceland]]. 
oppose,Not yet enough community experience IMHO. 
support,In my experience an excellent contributor and one whose edit count is not an accurate indication of the level of contribution to this site. Should be a good admin if not a proactive one methinks. 
support,Agree with Jwrosenzweig. 
support,Anyway Frazzydee has less than 2000 contributions and has a practically unanimous nomination... 
support,Agree with Jwrosenzweig. If you read through his userpage you'll discover that he also has contributions as an IP (nearly 200 more). You might also get a good idea of just how impressive an accomplishment his overall edit count really is under the circumstances. 
support,Checked through his edit history; I feel he's a very strong contributor. Potential to be a good admin here. 
support,Tireless & trustworthy imho. 
support,Numeric standards considered harmful. 
support,Absolutely. 
support,Of course. 
support,Great contributions over a fairly long period. 
oppose,Not at this time. Will probably support after 2000 edits. 
support,Very good choice glad he accepted. 
support,I believe AlainV's careful detailed factbased edits to truly encyclopedic articles are uncommonly valuable. 
oppose,Far to few edits thus far. 
support,You could have said more but from the user's edit history I doubt there will be trouble. 
support,Alex is a solid contributor and deserving of adminship. 
support,Of course.

support,Users who stay out of trouble are exactly the people we want as admins. 
support,Andrew has done a lot of good work on [[Mahathir bin Mohamad]] and other Malaysian topics. 
oppose,Far too few edits thus far for me to determine how he responds to different situations. 
oppose,I only looked at a few edits but they didn't seem very good. 
support,Andrewa is one of the few I often see taking care of those someoneshoulddoit type chores that I got too lazy for once the novelty wore off. Excellent choice I actually thought he was a sysop already. 
support,Good contributor and I think he'd make a good admin. 
support,I agree with Mkweise 
support,I thought he was one already too... 
support,A very good contributor. 
support,Ya. Very good helpful and active Wikipedian. 
support,Yup. 
support,A user whose initial experience of wikipedia was somewhat rocky but who showed great character by transforming that experience in ways that benefited the culture of wikipedia to positive long term effect. Definitely one of the best of us. 
support,He has shown good judgement. 
support,No objections at all. 
support,No objections here. 
oppose,Oppose. 
support,Seems to have a sound edit history 
support,ditto. 
support,Looks good. Hardworking and equinimanou... equinamio... fair. 
support,looks like he knows what he's doing 
oppose,Although this user has made a lot of contributions he has only been a logged in user for 18 days. I will definitely consider supporting him for adminship after more time has passed. 
oppose,Agreed with Mirv.....although I might have to wait till 8 weeks on principle. Still an excellent user with an incredible track record already. 
oppose,[[User Talk:Texture|&#964;]]
oppose,I agree its too soon but please try again after another six weeks. 
oppose,Too soon will certainly be renominated after a bit. 
oppose,No way. AndyL completely disrespects my work and I shudder to think of the retribution he would bring down upon me if he was an admin. 
oppose,Andy may become a good candidate but this nomination is premature. I concur 100% with Jwrosenzweig's comment above. 
oppose,Rude assumes bad faith and appears unable to debate in a polite manner. 
oppose,Nothing wrong with a little patience. 
support,See comment below. 
support,I get concerned when the summary trumpets VfD as something good without going into detail. However I see that Aranel is a balanced user in VfD and has made many good contributions :o). 
support,Good luck Aranel! 
support,An excellent choice. 
support,Aranel recently displayed superhuman patience in a public dispute. Good qualities for an admin.
support,A good range of work in many parts of the project 
support,Count me in. 
support,Most def. 
support,Oh yes. I've been noticing her everywhere in Wikipedia's "back corridors" lately. Hard worker. 
support,Very responsible editor 
support,Impressive... most impressive. 
support,It would be pretty strange for me to oppose a woman who studies physics and is into Tolkien.... 
support,Yep. 
support,Absolutely 
support,Already working hard as a Wikijanitor and doing a good job. An excellent candidate. 
support,Helped mucho in the Southern notice board. 100%. 
support,Why yes. 
support,Absolutely. Comes across both very friendly and productive. 
support,Strongly support. Very rational levelheaded person who considers what she says before she says it and knows what she's talking about. Fantastic person to deal with. 
support,[[User:Rhymeless|
support,Full support. I think Aranel will make a great sysop. 
support,As far as I can see there's no reason to oppose. 
support,Right. 
support,Yeppers. 
support,Isn't cable great? 
support,("
support,"cable" or "cabal"? ;) 
support,Another very fine choice for admin. . 
support,United in diversity! 
support,Sure.

support,An exemplary example of the type of person that a good Wikipedia contributor and would be a good sysop. 
support,Good person to have around [[User Talk:Texture|&#964;]]
support,Too bad Chad Pennington will kill him before he gets to use any of his real powers. (Arminius will understand this). 
support,An excellent contributor 
support,I'm surprised he wasn't nominated sooner. 
support,Seems a most sensible user. 
support,More Indians is good. 
support,Angela's right. I'm not only surprised that he wasn't nominated sooner; I was under the assumption that he was. Great work on mathematics and Indian history. 
support,Gladly.

oppose,Oppose. Don't appreciate personal attacks on the motives of people making VfD listings. 
support,Three cheers. 
support,Thought he was one. 
support,Seems like a fine [[Wikipedian]]. 
support,I've had some disagreements with him and the experience was painless. He seems like a good candidate for admiral/emperor/whatever this is for. 
support,Heh 
support,Yesyesyesyesyes. 
support,Older may not equal wiser but calmer does equal better at least for sysops and Bkonrad has shown a level head and good judgment in abundance. 
support,Wonderful. 
support,[[User Talk:Texture|&#964;]]
support,You mean he isn't already? 
support,of course. 
support,All for it. 
support,Keep. Er wait&hellip; 
support,Sometimes a [[Ikhthus|fish]] is just a [[cigar|fish]]. In any case we have many admins with strong personal views about both politics and religion. The important thing is that they respect the NPOV policy and not use their position to promote their viewpoint or suppress opposing views. I don't believe Blankfaze will do this so I support. 
support,If we asked our admins not to have opinionsor even not to make them clearI can think of dozens who wouldn't be admins any more. Blankfaze has always behaved well in his interactions with me and would make a good admin. [[User:Meelar|
support,Good nomination [[User Talk:Texture|&#964;]]
support,Hope you like this support ;P 
support,Because of the fish :D. We need people working on this to not take everything so seriously we are creating an encyclopedia but none of blankface's edits are biased and his parody is quite amusing. Just read the comments. Never mind. nonetheless. 
support,Blankfaze you're an excellent fellow and you'll make a good sysop. By the way I'm Vasco on IRC. 
oppose,Not yet enough experience here yet for me to get a full picture of how said user reacts in various situations. 
oppose,Blank is a good contributor but he's been here less than three months this is premature. I think I'll support if he is nominated later. 
support,Definitely support the [[Irish theatre]] originator. 
support,will use it well. 
support,definitely a good wikipedian. 
support,is a wonderful contributer. 
support,We can always use more wikijanitors who are willing to do these kinds of little tasks that all add up. 
support,Fine by me. 
support,Fair enough then. 
support,Yes. 
support,I think his comments on [[Talk:Felching]] show adminlevel sense of taste and restraint. I like to see editors take on "hobby tasks" (Sinead O'connor etc.) that nobody else is doing and I think this user satisfies most of my standards for admins. 
support,[[User:Marie Rowley|
support,I like what he says above. 
support,Seen good things from him. [[User:Rhymeless|
support,Looks good 
support,Ben and I had a misunderstanding some time ago but I'm not basing my vote on that at all. He's a fine contributor who's willing to tackle the craziness of certain aspects of this site. Anyone who is eager for the grunt work is worthy of the keys to the kingdom. 
support,although 800 edits is a little weak. 
support,Seems like a good contributor. 
support,Looks active enough to me. 
oppose,Not enough experience here yet IMHO. 
support,a quick view of her contributions convinced me she is definitely qualified. One noteif she was accepted via the mailing list in May should we even need this vote? 
support,I don't think there's any need to vote here since she was accepted in May 
support,If mav says yes I say yes (he has my proxy). 
support,Thought she already was one. Does a great job. 
support,Same as Hephaestos I'm surprised that you aren't one already. You deserve it just for the work we did on Atlas Shrugged... 
support,strongly. 
support,She will be good. What kind of irony is it that she was adminified over over a year ago but is still not a admin? O the Bureaucracy of Wikipedia! 
support,I don't think the guidelines for sysophood are too important. Cecropia is a good example of why you don't need x number of edits to be a sysop. 
support,01:06 29 Mar 2004 (UTC) He has probably been the most constructive contributor in the (generally wellbehaved) discussion over [[terrorism/draft]]. Maintains civility. A pleasure to work with. 
support,If Isomorphic trusts him I do. 
support,A solid contributor. 
support,I'm seriously missing something here. If there is a negative POV in an article and a user solicits a counter POV that's supposed to make the article NPOV. That doesn't mean that the user who contributed the counter POV is inherently POV him/herself it means they're trying to "neutralize" the article. All in all I've seen nothing but proper civility here at this discussion and feel that Cecropia has handled himself admirably. This is a rare case where I wasn't going to vote but was impressed by the user enough to vote in the positive. 
support,As much as I hate to agree with the two people who appear to be my archenemies support. A useful editor and time here is not an issue (Can <http://sources.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights the UDHR> be applied here?). 
support,Remarkably levelheaded and open. As with Dec 'the perfect temperament' to be an admin. 
support,support this guy looks like he knows what he's doing he looks like he has the time as well
support,I finially got around to looking into him and I can't see what the hold up is! 
support,after looking over his work; appears well qualified. 
support,Made longoverdue articles for [[Fall of the House of Usher]] and [[Jukes and Kallikaks]]. 
support,Although I would not support him to admiralship. *grins* 
oppose,Not yet enough experience here IMHO. This is nothing personal. I will most probably support at a later date. Cecropia is a valued contributor. 
oppose,This user set his personal support for George W. Bush over the interest of an unbiased community in numerous cases. E.g. he frequently used valuing expressions like "the argument is countered" and even included a lengthy <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=George_W._Bush&oldid=2813129 paragraph about "French German Russian commercial conenction to Saddam's Iraq" in the GWBush entry>. 
oppose,I find it funny how Cecropia is being nominated for "keeping it cool" with the George Bush article when (s)He has been just as POV as the rest of them (proBush POV). I don't claim to be any better but at least I don't try to pretend not to have any bias when my edits show completely otherwise. "ers of the administration counter..." removal of the accusation that the war broke international law etc. Heck at least I can point to a couple edits that I did that were favorable to Bush. What have you done at all that wasn't favorable to Bush? No offense to Cecropia personally this is an article for which it will be very hard to find anyone who doesn't have a POV. 
oppose,Does not follow NPOV. 
oppose,I have some issues with the various discussions above. I would be more comfortable at a later date when I've seen more. 
oppose,Oppose. 
oppose,Oppose. 
oppose,Oppose. Does not always follow NPOV; tries to discredit users opposing his position with polemics (e.g. labeling seriously meant contributions by as "comic relief" in [[Talk:George_W._Bush/Archive_5]]) 
oppose,Oppose. 
support,Chancemill has edited some contentious topics and remained calm in his discussion of them. Seems to handle conflict well. 
support,Angela never lies. 
support,I especially regard it important to have admins with knowledge about topics that are not among the most common ones the mainstream user tends to contribute to. To me it seems that 's interest in Indian and Hindu topics as well as a variety of others are very valuable for wikipedia. 
support,Excellent contributorbalanced very friendly sensitive good flair for writing. 
support,Though English is his second language he is *very* good in English; and also very *helpful* in correcting grammar and polishing articles. Also very knowledgeable in Tamil Sanskrit and Hindi. 
support,Polite and easy to deal with a fine wikipedian. 
oppose,Far too few edits thus far IMHO. 
oppose,Agreed. Sporadic edits to few distinct articles. 
support,if he is interested 
support,His good work goes way beyond maths. 
support,First post. PS it's me Mero from #wikipedia!! 
support,wholeheartedly. I actually thought about nominating you a few days ago but didn't get around to it. Sorry about that. Now show up at Chalmers damnit 
support,If people I trust support him I see no reason not to. And adminship should be no big deal anyway. [[User_talk:Anárion|<em style="fontfamily: Code2000 'Arial Unicode MS' sansserif; fontstyle: normal">Ⓐ&#8469;ά&#8475;ℹℴɴ</em]]>
support,14:39 16 Sep 2004 (UTC) Selfnoms should be given the same consideration; as long as they have at least one supporting vote it's almost the same thing no? And as Ananrion notes adminship is no big deal as desysopping is frequent and easy to achieve. <Reinserted after removed my vote. 
support,Although I waited too long and missed the opportunity to nominate him myself I'm glad to see he uses this opportunity to make a point I support about selfnominations. 
support,Yes ofcourse. [[User:Sverdrup|
support,<nowiki></nowiki> ([[User_talk:Andrevan|talk]])
support,Wasn't he already an administrator????? Strongly support. 
support,Indeed. 
support,strongly. 
support,I could have sworn I had already voted support but I'm not seeing it in the list. Well here it is now. 
support,Well this is a nobrainer. 
support,Hopping on the bandwagon and anyone that Mr Grinch opposes I endorse. 
support,Good user. 
support,Great user. 
support,Nice user. 
oppose,He's accused me several times of trolling and sockpuppetry without any grounds for such accusations. 
support,He's done a lot of great work with new users. 
support,Did a complete rewrite of [[Kosovo War]] that was really needed and has handled himself well with those that brought it to that state. 
support,Chris appears to have a good understanding of Wikipedia and would make a good sysop. 
support,Immense patience shown. 
support,A really good contributor and works towards NPOV on controversial articles on central/east european topics. 
support,nothing but net as far I can see... 
support,I've known Chris O since the early days of the [[Scientology vs. the Internet|Scientology Internet war]]. He has treated this infamously controversial subject with honesty and lack of bias and he has contributed enormously to those subjects here along with many others. 
support,I've seen nothing but good from Mr. O. 
support,welcome aboard! 
support,He's done a fine and much needed job on the Kosovo related articles and seems sensible....
support,Primarily because Wik trusts him. 
support,Absolutely. 
support,More edits than Ambi? That's quite a feat. 
support,Of course! He's a great contributor. 
support,Most certainly. 
support,Definitely!... His or her contributions to Australianrelated topics are remarkable!... and someone in which I think would be a good sysop 
support,Given my boundless respect admiration and affection for Our Ambivalently Hysterical One if she says Chuq is admin material that's good enough for me. 
support,I trust the judgement of other voters. 
support,<nowiki></nowiki> ([[User_talk:Andrevan|talk]])
oppose,Did not appreciate the attempt at suppressing real info and making a joke of it 
support,Seems a strong user. 
support,A very strong user [[User Talk:Texture|&#964;]]
support,Expecting to have seen lots of involvement in Wikipedia's debates only biases the process against the levelheaded kinds of people we need as admins. His reasonable tone and excellent work shows that he has internalized well the policies relevant to editing and I have no doubt that he can internalize the policies related to admin privileges as well. 
support,I recognize him (well his name anyway) from several other Canadian political forums (can.politics and the Election Prediction Project for two) and can attest that he knows his stuff. 
oppose,Will support after 2000 edits. 
support,Very strong support. User puts significant effort and content into his contributions. Seems to work well with others too. 
support,Big content contributor. Content almost always gives both sides of controversial issues not afraid to be neutral in edits. Even though I don't always agree with the amount of detail of what he adds it is generally best for the topics he edits. 
support,From my observation truly committed to NPOV ideals and knows how to write neutrally regardless of personal feelings on the subject matter. 
support,I've seen nothing but good from this user. 
support,Strongly support. 
support,I agree with all of the above an excellent contributor. 
support,I know next to nothing about the history of Mormonism but I can see the amount of effort put in and I'll trust other people's judgement that it's all good editing. Excellent work. 
support,Will support after 1336 edits. Oh wait a minute... 
oppose,Scope of work seems a little narrow and religious topics tend to make involved editors very overprotective. Also doesn't seem to be a very active editor 1335 edits over the course of one year is pretty low for someone who wants to be an admin. I don't see COgden participating in any routine maintenance efforts either. Would support in a couple months if he can become more involved but right now I don't see evidence that admin privilege is wellplaced here. 
support,Definitely support! 
support,Strongly support. 
support,Absolutely. 
support,I smell a grunt worker.. excellent candidate for adminship. 
support,Looking over the contribs I see nothing bad & lots of good. 
support,What Stormie said. 
support,Fair enough. 
support,OK. 
support,Yes. Seems Cool Head Luke and businesslike. Haven't personally seen him under fireDealt with him amicably on [[Reformed Egyptian]]; I imagine he is good at staying cool. 
support,Happy to. Even moreso considering the shoddy reasoning for opposing. 
support,You rock dude. 
support,As long as Luke's Cool Hand stays cool when the editing gets hot. 
support,I'm extremely happy to support Cool Hand Luke here. He's a great user and has helped out a lot with a whole bunch of topics. 
support,Yup. Adminship is no big deal and CHL is a valuable contributor. 
oppose,I admire the user and his work however he does not currently meet my for admin candidates. 
oppose,either. User is short on edits very short on edits for a selfnom and recent edits have been extremely minor adding categories and image tags voting on VfD. No I'd not consider until he performs more significant contributions and that he can convince someone to nominate him. 
oppose,Too few edits. 
support,Looks good to me. 
support,Good enough... Good user... Good edits... Good person... Gets good vote 
support,He passed every question of mine except favourite drink (the correct answer was 'tea' not 'coke'). Regardless he is a decent user. 
support,Strongly support. 
support,Goodnatured and a good grunt worker. 
support,By all means.

support,CryptoDerk is adminnable 
support,I've seen nothing but good edits from this user many of them antivandalism maintenance. Will make a good sysop.

support,Sure. <nowiki></nowiki> ([[User_talk:Andrevan|talk]])
support,Good nomination. 
support,I don't generally support cruelty to cyborgs but.... ;) 
support,I supported last time too and see no reason to change that. 
support,A low number of edits but they are good. 
support,Would prefer more edits but can hardly oppose in the above respectful company. 
support,I agree with Jfdwolff. 
support,Yo Cy...you got yourself some REAL heavy hitters in your camp. Good enough for me. 
support,I opposed his selfnomination but that was mainly because I'm inherently skeptical of selfnominations. Strongly support. 
support,I don't believe that those who do noncontroversial editing on noncontroversial topics are any less deserving of adminship. 
support,172 you forget the first... I dunno twenty admins who most definitely had less than 1000 edits... 
oppose,Oppose. User has less than 1000 edits. Over 150 of those edits are on his own user page . Also those edits often break down to many edits on one page (looking recently 14 for [[Symbolic combinatorics]] 8 for [[Semiempirical mass formula]]). This user has mostly editted pages on music he likes science fiction and electrical engineering. He has not been involved at all in pages like this one (requests for adminship) votes for deletion or any other page which shows him having much interaction with other Wikipedia users. This is something Johnleemk brought up during his previous selfnomination and I concur with him. We have no idea how he would act as an admin since his interaction has been limited and admin privileges are all about how he deal with interaction. He edits pages in his fields of interest occasionally posts on a discussion page and once in a blue moon has a discussion on a discussion page. Due to his limited number of edits which are on his user page or the same pages multiple times in a small number of fields and his lack of interaction with other users which is what admin power is all about I oppose this nomination. 
oppose,Oppose for the reasons listed above. I've seen nothing that suggests that this person is cut out to be an administrator. The mostly nonsubstantive comments in support of this nomination have done nothing to persuade me to vote in favour. I have to wonder what qualifies a person for a position of authority who has not even interacted with the community in any significant way. The standard should be higher than that. 
oppose,and with only two days left has not accepted the nomination nor answered the candidate questions. Lack of participation on this nomination page makes me very unimpressed. 
oppose,Oppose. Too few edits. 
oppose,While I agree with the arguments above and as under "Neutral" I do not really understand the reasons why people then say they are neutral to the candidacy. :> /
support,He's done plenty of good maintainance work. I strongly support anyone willing to do that stuff on a regular basis. ;) 
support,I know it's a cliche but I thought he was one. 
support,Very active. 
support,if he writes something more substantial that "Just some guy." on his user page and specifies an email address in his user preferences. 
support,Thought he already was one. 
support,Has been an excellent contributor in sports articles. 
support,If this is what he does working "only in spurts" his contributions put most of us to shame. 
support,Thought he already was one. Seems to have similar interests to me! 
support,Very productive good choice. 
support,Consistent completist etc. 
support,Ok. 
support,The first three "support" votes are enough to satisfy me. 
support,But of course. 
support,Yup. 
support,of course! It's great to have you back. 
support,enthusiastically. Wish he'd never left in the first place.

support,Haha I thought he already was one. 
support,David has gutshe isn't afraid to stand up for other users. (pumpie) 
oppose,I dont think that fixing your own mistakes is enough of a reason for wanting adminship. 
support,Good solid work and a lot of it! 
support,Though people who speak [[Esperanto]] frighten me Dave is an excellent worker and has a wellmeasured temperament. 
support,I've known from firsthand experience that David has the type of calm and coolheaded personality suitable for adminship. 
support,A worthy candidate who would have had this earlier had he succumbed to peer pressure more readily. ;) Glad to see him ready to take on the glory and tedium that is being an admin. 
support,Good contributions deals with minor disagreements coolly.

support,Certainly. 
support,The nomination blurb above is a little sketchy but seems to be a strong contributor. column has several heavy hitters. 
support,comment below.[[User:Bishonen|
support,Excellent choice. (As usual "I thought he was one already!") 
support,Excellent choice. 
support,Seen naught but good edits. 
support,Agreed! 
support,Another one whom I'm surprised they're not already... 
support,Good user. 
support,Well all right if Wik called you a moron and a vandal you'd probably be a good admin. 
support,All of us who have been attacked by Wik should stick together. 
support,Mon Dieu! If both Sam Spade and Gzornenplatz opposes you you can't be all wrong! /
support,I think it's fairly safe to say that Wik's view can be discarded in considering who would make a good admin. 
support,Seems like a good guy. And the fact that he said "Enjoyed working on Kylie Minogue" below I almost wet my pants laughing. 
support,support and despite trying my best to find it alarming and sinister I am completely untroubled by him leaving a silly comment (wagga wagga) on someone's talk page back in April. 
support,having said "wagga wagga" back in April is no reason for me to object. If the 'repeatedly' part of the 'inanities' allegations is demonstrated I may change to neutral (or even object). I also like the fact that he is not aggressively defending himself here letting people make up their own minds. 
support,Yes. Just one "mistake" of saying "Wagga Wagga" does not affect my support. [[User:Squash|
oppose,Wik doesn't make things up. Dmn repeatedly posted inanities like <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Wik&diff=3314886&oldid=3313987 this> on Wik's talk page. The "nasty things" Wik said which Dmn complains about below were apparently after Dmn started behaving like this. No sysop material. 
support,Excellent choice I should have thought to nominate him long ago. 
support,Great record along with opposition from anthony your perfect

support,I know I'm not the first to say this but I love the username. 
support,Hear hear both to the compliment on the username and Michael's assessment of DDG's suitability. . 
support,Finally someone I'm familiar with to vote for. An excellent choice. 
support,<cliche>He/she is not already an admin?!?!?!?!?!?!</cliche> Seriously this is a big surprise to me! . 
support,I thought you already were an admin. Jeez! 
support,Great contributor 
support,Unbelievable. I thought you were already an admin. 
support,from the gender neutral 
support,In my interactions with this editor I have been deeply impressed by his commitment and lack of stubbornness. I feel he is both responsible and committed. 
support,[[User Talk:Texture|&#964;]]
support,Strongly support. [[Soda can stove]] is the best article ever (or at least since [[exploding whale]]). 
support,I hope you're as great an administrator as you have been an editor. 
support,I quite liked Soda can stove and it got to the front page. Seems like a good editor not too controversial. Should be OK (fingers crossed!) 
support,I haven't encountered this user before but his list of contributions shows lots of good edits. 
support,Looks good lots of maintanance work. 
support,The quality of this user's work suggests sufficient knowledge to help other users as well as a commitment to the encyclopedia. 
support,Good [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia maintenance]] work. Will be good as admin. 
support,Duk is an awesome user! 
support,Sure why not? A fellow April 2004 registree. 
support,An Xmas eve admin if it is up to me. 
support,(why do we write "support" when there is a separate section for opposing votes?) 
support,Sounds like a great admin. Go for it. 
support,I am a little hesitant on the "spam" issue but Dunc wasn't responsible for it and I do note that the comment I saw didn't openly campaign for a vote either direction. While I don't care much for advertising I do grudgingly accept the right of people to publicize a RFA vote (though I wish they wouldn't do it on talk pages). Anyhow I've always had positive experiences with Duncharris and I think he would make an excellent admin. 
support,Has done lots of good work. 00:01 Nov 4 2004 (UTC). Moving back to support a single incident in so many edits doesn't seem such a big deal now I think about it. 
support,I have no reservations. I have fought against him; I have fought by his side; I have learned to respect this guy greatlyparticularly when we have disagreedbecause in fighting against him he has helped me learn about many pieces of history philosophy and science which I value highly. Incidently I also appreciated finding the advertisementwhich as a matter of fact had already been thoughtfully removed and was buried in the history file. But for the buried advertisement I might have missed this opportunity to vote for a great man! ) 
support,Dunc isn't an admin? Why? This makes no sense. and I can't think of any reason anyone would even be neutral. Strong user contributor and mediator. 
support,Somebody set up us the nomination. 
support,Make it so. 
support,Thought you already were one. . 
support,Excellent service record. . 
support,Dunc enjoy. Pleasant to work with. And almost 9000 edits is really great. 
support,Dunc is a trustworthy reliable genial user and would make a fine admin. 
support,support. 
support,He's not an administrator yet? 
support,because of the organized frothingatthemouth opposition. And would someone tell Sam Spade to stick to one name instead of changing his name at whim so we know who he really is? 
support,What RickK said. 
support,Graham is a pillar of Wikipedia. It's unconscionable that he is not a sysop. Full support! 
support,Calling a liar and a povpusher a liar and a povpusher is not a flaw (although the bullshit thing went just a little far). 
support,Holy crap you mean....Duncharris' not an admin? Well this is something we must certainly remedy right away! 
support,Yeah admin material. 
oppose,I oppose because he calls the return of the a Constitutional Monarchy in Vientam silliness and ridiculous idea also he called me a liar. I have been contributing articles relating to Vietnamese Royalty and the Vietnam War. I am a neutral person has been researching this since I was in College. A person should not be a Admin if they are using words like this to a Wikipedia members. This is not acceptable. please see evidence of his nonneutral position on the issue. I have never used any words concerning articles that he has presented as ridiculous or silliness and never called him a liar. I feel that this is not right nor it should be tolerated here on the wikipedia community http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Nguyen_Phuc_Buu_Chanh also please see "Please don't paste drivel onto my talk page. I'm just going to ignore you. I have better things to do. You're a aggressive povpushing crank. I'll make it easy for you bugger off and don't come back. Dunc|☺ 10:30 22 Oct 2004 (UTC)"
oppose,I am opposing because of the way he is treating Jimmyvanthach. I realize Jimmy has been a nuisance and a POV pusher who needs to be censured but administrators are held to a higher standard of diplomacy. Diplomacy factors heavily in my voting so I have to ask Dunch to practice it a bit longer. And Dunc I will continue to enjoy working with you on the Jimmy problem. p.s. With friends like me I realize you don't need enemies what with the "spam" and all. My sincerest regrets. 
oppose,Oppose due to treatment of Jimmyvanthatch [[Wikipedia:Civility]] is a keystone policy in my book. 
oppose,Civility issue pushes me to negative as above. 
oppose,Evidently my concerns expressed in my neutral vote weren't worth a reply so I change my vote to oppose. 
support,She was nominated by Jwrosenzweig she does great work and she uses my email signature. How can this go wrong? [[User:Meelar|
support,[[User Talk:Texture|&#964;]]
support,pending links from Kevin Baas. Well spoken recently on foundationl (even though I disagreed). Taking part in mediation shows that Denni is willing to compromise and build consensus. 
support,Sorry for the delay I was away from my computer for several days! Me too of course. 
support,Kevin Baas' arguments and links below thoroughly convinced me. 
support,I concur with David Gerard 
oppose,Does not work well with others. Violates policy. Obstructs transparency. See his talk page history he deletes user feedback on his talk page so that noone else can see it. He is currently undergoing a user dispute mediation for making personal attacks. (see the mediation page) 
support,someday we will get all those Ontario communities finished! 
support,An ideal nominee as best I can tell. 
support,Total support. Earl is a great worker. 
support,I've been very impressed with his work. 
support,Made a random check of his 2000+ edits very solid and good work nice stub patrol 
support,although I wish he'd make more use of the edit summary. 
oppose,Not what I would conciter admin material.
support,Yes. 
support,[[User:Avala|
support,I've reviewed many of his edits this month and he looks like he'd make a good sysop to me.

support,No more vacations for you. 
support,Glad to see her accept this nomination.

oppose,[[User talk:JRR Trollkien|Trollkien]] 
support,Very active. 
support,Extreme inclusionist voting on VfD almost like myself. 
support,enthusiastically. Mostly I've see him on VfD voting to keep things I'd rather see deleted. However a look the links on his user page shows him filling important gaps with good articles especially on African politcs. 
support,Aside from Jfdwolff he's the only editor I've heard of currently on this list. I think that counts for a lot. 
support,Inclusionism aside (there are far worse out there) he would make a very good admin 
support,Sysopship doesn't affect your VfD vote. Besides you know any admins who have gotten in trouble for not deleting something? 
oppose,Extreme inclusionist voting on VfD almost like Anthony. 
support,In my experience with Exploding boy he has not only shown himself to be a good contributor but quite reasonable as well. 
support,NEWCOMER RIGHTS! 
support,A keen contributor who seems communicative and collected. 
support,I have agreed w him and disagreed w him but I have never found him to be anything other than polite and reasonable definitely not one to lose his cool or be other than polite. 
support,I think it is a good thing for there to be some admins who are willing to take risks. The best growth happens at the edges where risk is taken. 
support,As a father who has problems bringing up children in the era of [[MTV]] and [[Nickelodeon TV channel|Nickelodeon]] (yes Nickelodeon) I have some problems with some of the material EB writes and edits being in an openlyavailable web encyclopedia; i.e. I wish there could be a separate section. However I've reviewed EB's material in terms of the usefulness quality and fairness of his work so I am disinclined to throw out [[the baby with the bathwater]] as it were and therefore 
support,Inasmuch as we have a longstanding policy of permitting and even encouraging articles such as [[fuck]] [[felching]] and the photographically illustrated article [[clitoris]] it seems unwise to penalize this user for largely similar material at [[Finger fucking]] or especially the relatively tame factbased entry at [[Collar (BDSM)]]. If we do not wish to have such articles let us develop a policy prohibiting them before we act against their creators. 
support,All encyclopedic information should be in Wikipedia not just the information that's safe for little kids and revivalist missionaries. for adminship.
support,1) I've seen good things from EB and 2) any candidate who can unite the various corners of this site's political spectrum as seen in the votes above is obviously a good choice. 
support,Has shown he can work with others even on controversial subjects. 
oppose,Exploding Boy is creating innapropriate articles like [[Finger fucking]] and [[Collar (BDSM)]]. 
support,I certainly support him. 
support,He's done an amazing job at the Russian WikiProject. 
support,We need more multilingual sysops. 
support,Definately. [[User:Ilyanep|

In other words I don't think someone with 1200 edits is quite "jaded" enough for adminship. Will gladly support after 2000. 
support,Absolutely support. A true pleasure to work with. 
support,We need more beanshaped editors! 
support,4 supporting votes within 10 minutes this is looking positive! 
support,Above reasons. 
support,Very active contributor and editor. 
support,I thought he was sysop already. He also understands the use of the summary field. 
support,Absolutely 
support,you beat me to it. 
support,support. whats he gonna do wrong (if hes been here 3 months) that he wouldn't have already done? Nothing. 
support,mostly b/c yay fabi and in part because I'm against having vaguely defined time requirements. There either needs to be a "law" regarding required tenure or people's qualification for admin should be based on overall performance. 
support,wholeheartedly 
support,the edits speak for themselves. 
support,This is very difficult for me as I agree with Angela and Dori that I would have much preferred to wait a month. However I asked myself what the standards are forthey are to ensure that we promote admins who are truly devoted to how we do things here and not about to cause trouble. Fabiform has done a tremendous job of gaining my trust here and I have no doubts about integrity or dedication. Therefore I (carefully and in considered fashion) set aside my general guideline for an exceptional case. 
support,A very friendly and dedicated contributor. 
support,Good people are good people. The time limit is only a guideline not an ironclad rule to chain us. 
support,No question I'd put forward a small idea on W:FPC and Fabi jumps in and does the hard yakka coding it Thanks mate 
support,Users like Fabiform are a perfect example of why I dislike fixed time/edit requirements for admins. 
support,I've changed my vote from neutral to support. Never mind about silly rules like 3 months. Fabiform will be a good admin whether made one now or next month. 
support,Has definitely given me a good impression. 
support,Absolutely support. 
support,dedicated contributor (as a newbie completed the whole list of authors abandoned by me 
support,Fabiform is a great dedicated editor. 
support,[[Pro forma|Pro fabi]] support excluding unusual and nonrecurring actions. 
oppose,Fabiform is embarassed that she has unanimous support and she requested that I oppose him to balance things a bit. 
oppose,Oppose. Power corrupts and administrator power corrupts stratospherically. I like fabi and her nonspherical shape just the way they are. Say NO to corruption vote for the status quo! 
oppose,I believe that fabiform would not be a good candidate for admin. However let me begin my essay by first noting that I am a bureaucrat and a sysop. There. Now I shall begin. Firstly I must adjust my tie. Ok there we go. Firstly fabiform is beanshaped. I do not like people who are beanshaped; rather I generally eat them. Unless they are beans which cause a large amount of flatulence and are generally unhealthy. Bean products are okay however especially those containing peanut butter. Peanut butter and jelly sandwiches are good but not those they serve at my school's cafeteria. However I digress. Secondly fabiform does not know how to speak Korean. I discriminate against those who cannot speak Korean. Third he she has actually helped me and I hate people who actually help me. Fourthly he she spells his her name with a lowercase 'f' which is copying my signature. Fifthly... he she participates on the IRC channel. Sixthly I am hypocritical; however that does not mean that fabiform should be an administrator. Seventhly... I wholeheartedly unanimously Canadianly oppose him her adminship as a fervent antidisestablishmentarianist. Eighthly she's a girl :(. 
support,Although he is relativly new to Wikipedia I support. Good to work with. 
support,Fennec's stats may not look impressive but he is very active on the IRC channel and has helped fight off vandalism and contributed to policy discussions on multiple occasions (notably helping to document the Bird/Brain affair) being consistently thoughtful humorous inquisitive and courteous. I was going to nominate him two couple weeks ago until I saw how new he was; but RfA votes should be based upon reputation and past actions; based on those criteriaFennec will make an excellent admin. 
support,Definitely. 
support,Fennec is relatively new but he has been very active in that time and appears to have an excellent understanding of Wikipedia policies. 
support,Nice to have you. 
support,I know him from other IRC channels too and his Edit history looks good too. He won't wreak havoc for sure. 
support,Again a good case for flexibility of guidelines. Unlikely to act any worse no matter how long we wait. 
support,Confident that he'd do well. 
support,Looks good to me. 
support,It is a little early but my opinion of them and their behaviour is unlikely to change. 
support,Definite support! 
support,Maybe some young sysop blood will help everything 
support,Sure he's pretty new.. but I think he's both friendly and trustworthy. 
support,Changed vote to support after checking (solid) edit history. 
support,Fennec pointed me to Wiki's that are much better than this crappy old one so for that I'll vote for him/her/it/whatever. 
support,I support him Fennec's an effective syop and i like him
support,Amiable. Promising contributions. I'm starting to sound like a [[horoscope]]. ! 
oppose,Too new. 
oppose,Too new. 
oppose,At a later date I will most probably support. It is just too soon according to my personal gauge for this. Still too few edits. P.S. I love the [[:Image:Lovebirds.family.jpeg|birds]]. 
oppose,Too new will support if nominated again in a month or so 
oppose,Too new. Do we urgently need new admins? 
oppose,Changing my vote to Oppose. His insertion of an unfunny "April Fool's Joke" on this page today demonstrates to me that he doesn't have particularly good judgment. 
oppose,What's the hurry is there a shortage of admins? Why not wait 4 more weeks and nominate then. 
support,Whoops forgot to vote here! As the nominator I of course support! 
support,Yes. 
support,I thought he was one already definately support. 
support,Also support. 
support,impressive vandal hunting. 
support,Hear hear. 
support,Seriously however much of a cliché I can not believe Ferkelparade wasn't already etc.
support,Absolutely: A good amount of time on the project exposure to the tough spots maintained poise throughout good judgment. 
support,rollback functionality needs to be used by people like he. 
support,Yes and yes. 
support,Yes rollback for FP. 
support,He's seen so many (other peoples') adminship requests go by so many times that he well deserves one for himself now. 
support,Yes let's have more admins who don't keep a watchlist. It's all too easy to use it as a crutch to article ownership. 
support,Happy to. Even moreso considering the shoddy reasoning for opposing. 
support,Btw why the double Ff? 
support,OK I can overlook the bizarre doubleF. Seriously...strong support! 
support,Excellent contributor. Enough edits for me. 
support,I'd prefer nominations to come up after more time on the project (time not edits) to see the user in interaction with disagreeing and disagreeable folks but I've already seen ffirehorse in situations like that and he or she has responded reasonably. 
support,Good contributions committed good attitude. 
support,I like how you patrol cleanup. 
oppose,I admire the user and his work however he does not currently meet my for admin candidates. 
oppose,Has not been here long enough. 
oppose,120 edits is too low IMO.

support,The few times I've encountered him here he seems to be doing very good work. 
support,Seems sensible 
support,Francs2000 speaks modestly; he is a prime candidate for sysophod. 
support,Good edits. Interest in thwarting vandals. No history of edit wars or trolling at all. 
support,(web of trust thing) 
support,A very mature and responsible editor. Just gave me his advice on adding a new picture to [[Church]] in fact. Strongly support. 
support,Very responsible editor. Known him since the age of 5. Wholly deserving. 
support,Lots of good work on reverting vandalism cleaning up pages. 
support,[[User Talk:Texture|&#964;]]
support,Oh boy I was about to nominate him. 
support,Enthusiastically support. Frazz has shown nothing but class empathy and clear levelheaded thinking. He's also shown some real friendship. I'd vote twice if I could!! 
support,even if he tried to delete my articles (He was right at that time) 
support,Strongly support! 
support,Already working hard on speedies. 
support,very intelligent and hardworking person from my conversations with him in private messages Wikipedia and the #Wikipedia channel.

support,I've been here about as long as you have but I don't have nearly as much edits as that. I'm wondering how much time you spent online to reach that count... [[User:MacGyverMagic|

oppose,No. Simply put. Candidate has history of erasing worthy pages without putting them on VfD first and who knows what he would do as a sypop. If he shows me signs of having matured then maybe Ill change my vote. "
support,gladly. Gaz is a true gentleman and a pleasure to work with. I should have nominated him myself. 
support,Helping via [[Wikipedia:Featured pictures candidates]] to encouragee WP image makers and photo takers to do their best. 
oppose,Less than 1000 edits. That is not many considering the amount of time the user has been here. Also usage has been sporatic including a 2 month hiatus. Gaz didn't really catch fire until February 2004. Try another nomination in May 2004 IMHO. 
support,Strongly. 
support,Mhmm. 
support,Previous comments were several months ago. Users change their minds. Patton is a good user. 
support,I think people can change especially in concern to their early days at this project. I've seen a lot of good out of GeneralPatton and I think he'd make a fine admin. 
support,He may be a disputant on and off but he knows how to deal with those disputes in a calm collected fashion. 
support,I don't vote here all that often but Patton has my wholehearted support. He's a trustworthy user who has done a lot of good work here for a long time. 
support,Easy descision. [[User:Sam Spade|
support,Has been polite when I have observed him; I see no reason to oppose. 
support,Yes. [[User:Squash|
support,Seems like a good user. 
support,Good nomination. I don't really care about the comment he made over four months ago.Adminship should be no big deal. 
support,I am confident that GP has the project's best interests in mind. He has been extremely active in metawork (e.g. policy) and communicates admirably well for a nonnative English speaker. 
support,Friendly and courteous user who seems actively interested in wikipedia policy. 
support,Has been very helpful when I've hopped on IRC with a question about arbitration. 
support,I've been intermittent touch with Patton for several months in which I have seen him grow from someone who I'd be wary to give adminship to (like the general he's taken the name of he was a bit brash and impulsive) to someone I feel can be trusted with the duties and responsibilities of administration. His more recent contributions have often centered around adding hard to find details (always with a source) and often attempting to remove the POV in articles which usually generate them naturally. 
support,You have my full support. We would be doing a disservice to Wikipedia by denying such a helpful and dedicated user admin powers
support,Absolutely (I thought he was already). I'd like to note that the username thing is selectively enforcedthat or no one realizes I named myself after [[August von Mackensen]] (granted that was sixteen months ago). I do agree that he should take 's advice. 
support,Strong I checked a number of his edits his interactions with other users and grilled him over them on irc. I could find no current flaws so he has my support. He then answered some truely tough questions from me and gave me his opinion on a hypothetical scenario. His answers were very much to my liking so that earns him a strong support. 
support,[[User:BrokenSegue|
oppose,Last we talked the devil told me the temperatures in hell were still unseasonably warm. 
oppose,My first and only experience with the General has not been good: apparantly he got [[:Image:Vaginal syphilis.jpg]] deleted without any process (that I have found) he then uploaded the same image at [[:Image:Vaginal syphilis(disturbing image).jpg]] without any comment or description. He has replaced small thumbs in the [[Syphilis]] article with links disregarding former discussion (or making any comments himself) and not using the "edit summary". The result is two paragraphs starting with a line with an image link and thumbdescription. While I know the comlplaint doesn't really belong here I suspect others would be asking if I didn't give my reasons. 
oppose,It is definitely not good to have really biased administrator. Nor one who uses Croatian insults in edit summaries ("pickica" <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=List_of_Croatians&diff=3629580&oldid=3621463> "serem ti sliku kralja petra" <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=List_of_Croatians&diff=3636404&oldid=3636399>). 
oppose,Strong oppose. I don't think he's a bad guy but we've butted heads over his inability to understand what NPOV means even in the most basic sense. As reference see our discussions on [[Talk:Robert Oppenheimer]] (a few months ago) [[Talk:Wernher von Braun]] (a few months ago) and [[Talk:Nazi Germany]] (last week when he suggested and defended his use of a selfdescribed holocaust/historical denial website as a valid source for resolving a minor squabble). I think he is an earnest contributor but I don't think he has very good negotiation skills good historical reasoning or good methodology. And I think he has some legitimate conceptual problems with understand what NPOV means in any applicable sense. If you want to see this in practice again view my frustrations on [[Talk:Robert Oppenheimer]]. Sorry GeneralPatton nothing against you personally you seem like a nice enough guy and I don't think you mean to antagonize but I think you often just don't get what Wikipedia articles should be about in a very fundamental way and I haven't really seen any improvement in this to be honest. I haven't seen you use good editing judgment or communication skills. These seem to me to be rather important for any administrator position even with as lackofstatus as it is supposed to be. Even if the user has reformed since last July (which my latest disagreement with him suggests to me that he has not) I see this as being a somewhat provisional state and definitely not compelling a vote for adminship. (I'm someone who sometimes has strong opinions about uses of historical sources and statements so please read the discussions linked and decide for yourself don't just take my word for it.) 
oppose,Poor (nil) use of edit summaries and "Show preview". I don't see any effort to perform routine maintenance. Has some welldocumented biases and is friends with some the worst POV warriors around here. I also don't like that it looks like he's using friends from IRC to do favors for him (re: the syphillis image). 
oppose,Oppose. Does not make proper use of edit summaries. 
oppose,Oppose. I think 3 months on wikipedia should be more than enough time to grind down the rough edges. I prefer admins to be a little more active on chores and a little more sensitive to the needs of the community pretty much right away. The longer it takes a user to become accustomed to simple editing and discussion the longer I expect them to wait for adminship. Also I'd like to see more activity behind the scenes.

support,I let this go an extra halfday to see if anything new would develop or another bureaucrat wanted to make a decision but the voting stands where it did since before formal closing. I considered the formal objections (nature quality and strength) I looked at the Thimerosol page that ElBenevolente cited I looked at a sampling of Geni's work and I read over Theresa Knott's explanation of the nature of Geni's "edit warring." Taking all into account Geni's apparent temperament and length of time here I find that this falling into the "grey zone" there is no compelling reason to withhold adminship therefore I am supporting and promoting. 
oppose,. Evidence of "RC patrol" only within the last 3 days. They should become more active in the maintenance area and then check back in a couple months (hopefully with a full nomination). 
oppose,Oppose. Seems like a good user and I would support in all liklihood with some more experience. RC patrol is good but I would like to see more content creation. Self nom's should exceed the standards by a good margin. 
oppose,Oppose. User has very strange understanding of NPOV claiming that "mercurybased" indicated a POV in the [[Thimerosal]] page (see [[Talk:Thimerosal]]) despite the fact that thimerosal is clearly mercurybased and that this assertion is even supported by proponents of thimerosal.

While I have no doubt about the integrity and good intentions of this user and it's obvious they care about Wikipedia I do not feel comfortable voting for someone with whom I have such strong and fundamental disagreements regarding what Wikipedia should be and how it should be run at least while people consider adminship to be an important and ponderous privilege (to borrow someone else's words: but I feel this is quite a widely held sentiment).

support,but recommend Guanaco follows the recommendation to provide edit summaries. [[User Talk:Texture|&#964;]]
support,Wikipedia is not Kingturtle's exclusive country club. 
support,Seems to understand the criteria for speedy deletion at least. 
support,What I've seen from him is good. Helpful in watching recent changes. 
support,Absolutely. Good work with VfD.
oppose,Not here long enough. Not enough edits. 
oppose,Too new. 
support,Certainly a good grasp of policy as evidenced by VFD contributions. Also note that his edits prior to about August were completely VFDfree which makes up for any bias against him for this reason. For the record he does have more than 2000 edits. 
support,Seems solid. Since he's done so much VfD work I took a close look at ithis votes seem to be much in line with community consensus and on more controversial topics he justifies his opinion well. 
support,I've had numerous interactions with Gwalla and all were positive. Very reasonable and hardworking editor perhaps with a mild VfD addiction but I've seen nothing but excellent articlerelated edits too. 
support,If anything the VfD work is a plus VfD is one of the 'policy areas' of Wikipedia and mature contributions there in addition to the more general areas of the site are a plus. I feel Gwalla has contributed well to Wikipedia. 
support,Go Gwalla! ! And endorsed by Heresiarch as well. 
support,Examined a number of user's edits in main and talk namespaces; all are good as far as I've seen. Appears willing and able to explain himself when necessary to distinguish between his personal interests and the good of Wikipedia and to resolve disputes amicably and according to policy. Level of attention to VfD is abnormal but an examination of voting patterns does not suggest an agenda (especially since the number of articles he nominates is relatively low) and a willingness to participate in this administrative task seems like an argument for adminship not against it.
support,All of the user's edits seem to be in good faith. If one of the detractors could cite concrete examples of a frivolous deletion it might make more sense. 
support,Absolutely. I also think people opposing on the basis that he thinks most of the VfD nominators are correct are missing the spirit of the project. Our users nominate for VfD wisely for the most part so it's not surprising to see mainly "delete" votes. Will Gwalla be a good administrator? Absolutely. 
support,Being a deletionist is not a valid reason to oppose adminship. 
support,Slightly overzealous VfDing gives me a lack of clear sense of this user. Vote moved to support. <nowiki></nowiki> ([[User_talk:Andrevan|talk]])

support,Good edits including in VfD. No evidence of serious conflicts with others. 
support,Good unbiased edits in VfD. 
oppose,Approximately 70% of his recent contributions have to do with VfD. Oppose. Sorry. 
oppose,I'm with Lst on this one. Over 1000 VfD votes logged in the last 2 months vast majority are deletes. With no significant edits outside of VfD and a lot of repetitive minor edits not sure how we can gauge his readiness for adminship. () 
oppose,I agree. User is a bit too VfDzealous. Any way not enough edits in my book. Would possibly support after 2000 edits and a branch out in his contribs. 
oppose,Too little edits too many deletions. 
support,The time period is shortish but hard to imagine that I would think differently two months for now. 
support,gladly. He's very attentive and responsive. This gemmologist will make a friendly admin. 
support,I too am concerned a little about the briefness of time here but I think it's borderline enough that Hadal's good record of edits and combatting the occasional vandal makes him a wise choice. 
support,I think his edits prove him trustworthy. 
support,along the same lines as Metasquares. 
support,Thought he was one already. 
support,Newish but a good sense of balance. 
support,Good edits and has been here longer than I had when I became an admin. 
support,Count me as neutral. I do think Hadal is a good choice for adminship but I'm worried about the fact he's been here less than three months. 
support,I'm neutral too. I agree with Angela while noting he has been very good so far. 
oppose,It is simply too soon. We should not set this precedent. I will gladly support Hadal in a few months. 
oppose,Oppose solely on the grounds that Hadal hasn't been here long enough. 
support,(Strongly) Totally concur with Viajero's comments above. 
support,I concur. 
support,I checked and discovered he wasn't an admin yet. ;) 
support,I'm pretty familiar with his work on Wikipedia and he's a really good NPOV contributor particularly on religion issues. He's devoted to Wikipedia policies and he's been actively involved in resolving a number of significant POV disputes; for good examples see [[Talk:Mormonism and Christianity]] and [[Talk:Human]]. 
support,Tom has fewer edits in my opinion because he works on contentious articles and unlike so many of us he works slowly and carefully to establish a consensus version of a contentious passage before adding it. Rather than accumulate edits in the article space by hammering out a version in back and forth he accumulates those edits on the talk page preferable in my opinion. Another fine editor with the perfect demeanor for admin who should not be penalized for his careful style simply because it generates fewer edits than those of us who forget to hit "Show Preview". 
support,You've got the right idea. I apologise I thought you'd been around since September 2004. ;) 
support,I've worked with Tom and find him to be a patient knowledgeable and effective consensusbuilder. If sysops are to be wikipedia's diplomats Tom is a topnotch candidate. He edits reverts and adds impressive content to explosively POV subjects. His minewalking should be acknowledged. 
support,I like what I see. 
support,<nowiki></nowiki> ([[User_talk:Andrevan|talk]])
support,I know that my vote here will have no effect on how he treats what I say. 
support,Knowledge and courtesy are okay in my book. 
support,Should have been done a long time ago Tom gets my support. 
support,I was originally going to oppose because most of Tom's articlerelated edits are focused on religious topics. It's generally a good thing to have admins with broad interests. But then I remembered that religion is a ridiculuously huge target for POV warriors; [[WP:RFC]] attracts Zionism like a magnet. In Tom we have a reasonable thickskinned editor who prefers religion as a topic. On top of this he follows the NPOV policy acts as a mediator and has said "I would most likely not initially use my administrative privileges at all". Whoa. Tom has my full support. 
support,Skimmed through his history and I'm impressed: consensus builder and dedicated to NPOV. Also answered question 3 well. 
oppose,Seems like a very nice user prone to discussing things rationally and with courtesy. Problem is the 1356 edits; of those 457 are in Talk: 370 in User: and only 23 are in Wikipedia:. The rest of edits in a very narrow scope surrounding the religion subject. Sorry doesn't meet my since we can't gauge readiness. 
oppose,Agree with Netoholic. 
oppose,Far too few edits by my standards. Would probably support after 2000 edits and a wider variety in topics edited. 
oppose,Based on my recent experience with Hawstom mediating an [[User_talk:Rednblu#Allegations_against_User:Rednblu|dispute]] over a user's alleged POV campaigning in bad faith I can not recommend Hawstom as an Admin. Though I do not doubt his initial intention to remain objective in the mediation he publicly slipped a number of times in being overly deferential to one party and made several explicit and implied statements favoring one party in the mediation both on User talk pages and by email. His NPOV in the dispute was far from complete/optimal. Hawstom also was unaware of the wikipolicy on [[Wikipedia:Refactoring#When_to_refactor|Refactoring]] a policy central to the allegations and only became aware of it when I pointed it out. His method for resolving the dispute was lengthy inefficient and did not produce tangible results. Questionable tactics employed by one party in the mediation went unchecked by Hawstom as did a number of ad hominems. Additionally Hawstom failed to respond/reply to my 5 emails sent in reply to his contacting me. When asked about this he promised to respond to them but still has not. In defense of Hawstom he had a prior friendly working relationship with the defendant so remaining genuinely neutral would have been a real struggle for anyone. But that also causes me to wonder why Hawstom initiated the mediation (I did not seek it) and that he mediate it in the first place.
support,Having worked with him I can say that HCheney is a model contributor. If anyone deserves this it's him. And I can understand being disillusionedthat was a confusing frustrating and unpleasant situation for all concerned. However that was in no way due to HCheney him(?)self. 
support,Having reviewed a random selection of his edits I found nothing to complain about and much that was good. A thoughtful and responsible editor. 
support,Hold up hold up... You mean he wasn't one already? 
support,I've disagreed with Hcheney but I believe he is a conscientious and wellintentioned contributor. 
support,good responsible editor. &#8212;
support,only seen good things. 
support,Wik's objections are invalid. As much as I dislike Grazingship Hcheney has nothing to do with that. 
support,I was working on a Perl parser to help me analyze User contribution pages using HCheney's contributions as test input. Then I realized that I'd better vote for him before I finished because his time is running out. Nice work! 
oppose,He did not act impressively at all when previously nominated and withdrew his acceptance not "when it became obvious that foul play was occurring" but only in the last moment when it became obvious he would not get a consensus (when the vote stood at 159). His "impressive" reaction actually consisted in making a pretense of leaving <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User:Hcheney&diff=3011484&oldid=2907317> which lasted about a week. He also said "The entire RfA process has completely disillusioned me" which is strange if he wasn't requesting adminship himself why would he care so much about it? I still suspect that Hcheney and GrazingshipIV are the same person and he cares too much about adminship much like Alex Plank. 
oppose,Vandalized my website (see <http://www.mcfly.org/wik/Natalie_Paff> if you care). Lied or at least was not forthcoming about Grazingshihp last time he was nominated (and Grazingship is in my http logs reading his vandalism right after he created it clearly they were closer than he is admitting). I'd support given a bit more time and a bit more explanation as to his previous actions as he has kept a low profile since withdrawing his nomination but it's a bit too soon IMHO. 
oppose,Still not enough experience with the community IMHO. 
oppose,Enough weirdness with the whole weird thing from before that I think it might be a good idea to hold off for a while. 
support,I think Hemanshu can be trusted with sysop responsibilities.

support,As yet another nonlawyer I am sometimes concerned that Jamesday's copyright opinions are not fully accurate (though never enough to be concerned about him as an editorbesides I know far less than he does about copyright law) but I am always pleased by his thorough and generally clear reasoning in such discussions. Also I do not believe that granting him sysop status will affect the copyright concerns at allhe will be no more or less likely to promote the stance that RickK objects to and as noted above I'm not convinced there's anything wrong with his stance.

support,I'm changing my vote. I stand by my reasoning below (which has more to do with WP procedures than Jayjg personally) but Jayjg's behaviour here has convinced me that he's capable of seperating his personal POVs and admin tasks so I trust Jayjg. 
support,After hours of searching I found only one single instance of Jayjg stating something to the effect of his POV being NPOV when I thought it wasn't which is why I feel confident in supporting his candidacy. His manifest civilty is a strong additional plus! 
support,Hey wait a minute! I know who you are! :P

I trust him not to abuse the latter. 
oppose,I believe him to be biased on several important topics to the point that I question his ability to remain neutral in disputes and use powers such as protection responsibly and without bias. 
oppose,From what I've seen so far I haven't been too impressed. Would perhaps reconsider at a later date. 
oppose,If he isn't aware of "how rogue admins are reigned in" then he needs to do more reading before becoming an admin. [[User Talk:Texture|&#964;]]

I would offer a bit of advice though had Mydogategodshat become an admin I think he/she would have had to be careful in working with religious issues (I didn't object to the name at all and supported adminship both times). For the same reasons I don't think Neutrality should feel forced to change his/her name but I hope N. will consider being extra careful when interacting with new users especially if admin powers are invoked despite my firm belief that N. should keep his/her name I do feel there is a possibility of confusion for new editors. I trust Neutrality to keep this in mind and have great faith in N's ability to be a trustworthy admin.

support,The hat does not make the man. One minor point against for POV support for the Forces of Good in his acceptance comment. (On a tangent; capability for crisp rhetoric as preclusionary criterion would eliminate 85 percent of current admins.)

support,Again he isn't an admin? 
support,Absolutely. Been here since long before I showed up and never had a problem as far as I know. 
support,! 
support,Slam dunk is the term being used I believe. 
support,Absolutely. His integrity talent quality of judgement and dedication to the project are beyond question. 
support,Agree with Kosebamse.

support,But who's this Atque Vale person and why do you keep on telling him to go away? 
support,I voted oppose last time but now I recognize the username and associate it with positive contributions to Wikipedia. As such I support. 
support,Absolutely. I wanted to support last time too but felt that the nomination came too early. It has been plenty of time and I enthusiastically support the nomination.

support,I also opposed last time (time on project) but now vote Continued positive contributions without conflict. More activites would have been a plus but are not a requirement. I see no reason not to trust PS with adminship.

support,Absolutely.

support,Seems like a good user. 
oppose,See below. 
oppose,Agree with Netoholic. The way he tracks his own edit count on his user page leads me to believe that he deliberately fails to use the preview button in order to boost his "ranking" as if he could win a prize for that. 
oppose,See comments below. 
oppose,I do not feel that having the stated intention of using admin powers to guard pages you have worked on is anything I can support. I also feel that if you nominate yourself for a position you should have the good sense to do so at a time when you will be able to monitor the process. 
oppose,Oppose. 
support,Does plenty of necessary work with templates and project pages. Seems like he will treat the "keys to the mop closet" well.

support,Absolutely. Welcome back in advance ;) 
support,Not necessary at all. Admins in good standing who voluntarilly gave up their status should be able to return without a vote. Oh and he's a good contributor by the way. 
support,As there was no reason for him to lose it in the first place I see no reason he should not have his adminship back.

support,| [[User talk:Elf|Talk]] 04:01 9 Jul 2004 (UTC). In my limited dealings with Quadell my general impression is of someone who is flexible cheerful agreeable a quick learner & willing to go exploring to find out more about Wikipedia. 
support,[[User:OldakQuill|
support,Looking through contributions a lot of them several hundred at least are minor edits mostly adding categories to articles. That's no criticism: it's all necessary work. But it does mean that you perhaps don't have as much experience as some others might have with the same number of edits. Combined with the fact that this is a selfnomination I'm inclined to oppose for now but would certainly reconsider in a couple of months. is right adminship should be no big deal. On that basis and on the basis of what Quadell has said here and on the basis that other Wikipedians who I greatly respect seem to have no problem I'm moving to neutral. As with at least one other here I have found myself in all three camps over the course of this nomination. But unlike I've ended up in I've read carefully over all aspects of this issue and Quadell's response to it. He demonstrates maturity and a commitment to NPOV (regardless of his own point of view). ing and hopefully this will be the last time I move my vote! > 
support,My concerns have been addressed. . 
support,Ditto what Dick said. 
support,Hopefully the last time I move my vote 
oppose,Your response to the threatened libel action on [[Talk:Khalid bin Mahfouz]] doesn't give me confidence that you have the maturity needed. 
oppose,I agree (to oppose). A paragraph wrote on [[Talk:Khalid bin Mahfouz]] has created a much greater threat to Wikipedia than the original article. I suspect Quadell does not know why. If is correct that Quadell is flexible cheerful agreeable (and) a quick learner then I guess I might change my opinion in a few months time.
oppose,I've never voted against anyone before usually I abstain if I choose not to vote positively. But in regards to [[Khalid bin Mahfouz]] as well as Quadell's user page I must agree with Moriori as it troubles me to think of the consequences if something like this happened repeatedly. 
oppose,Wow this is the first time I've ever voted in Oppose and Neutral on one person. But seriously: I was originally only going to withdraw my support vote by I am really concerned with the [[Khalid bin Mahfouz]] stuff. I don't think you're ready for this. Get a clear head and come back in a few months. Nothing personal. 
support,Very impressive history. Great images uploaded. Thorough edits. Wellthoughtout redirects. Battles with vandals. No edit wars. Likes baseball. 
support,I'm quite impressed by his user history as well. He's been quite a diligent and active copyeditor. 
support,Quality contributor. 
support,Good levelheaded contributor. 
support,Seems to be both active _and_ unusually reasonable. Doesn't seem to heat up easily either which is always a plus. 
support,Excellent work on Chinarelated topics. . 
support,Of course. 
support,Absolutely. Responded very quickly when I needed help communicating with a problem Chinese contributor whose English is not so good. 
support,Ok. 
support,Great work seems to keep cool when the heat is on. 
support,Yep. Fluency in Chinese is a plus too.
oppose,I hope Ran has "truly learned what NPOV means" but I'm not convinced yet. On [[Tibet]] he seemed to have trouble recognising that other viewpoints should be mentioned and with using the talk page to negotiate changes where topics are controversial. I think more time is needed. 
support,As long as he agrees not to knock minor edits ;)

support,Definitely. A valuable contributor and I believe he'll take adminship very seriously. 
support,Conscientious hard working. 
support,<insert something witty and intelligent here>
support,Any adminnominated contributor who is described as a model of consensus building gets my unqualified support. 
support,Strikes me as being good admin material. 
support,On second thought yes: support. 
support,Helpull person! protects users from abuse
support,I and my sockpuppets give unswerving support. 
support,A model of NPOV editing. If he can watch so many controversial articles for POV without going nuts he's unflappable. 
support,As it says above "a model of NPOV and consensus building". 
oppose,Too few edits. 
oppose,Short on total edits (I 2000+). Also some unresolved accusations of sock puppet use in the [[Wikipedia:Requests for mediation/Archive 10#User:Chuck F and User:Rhobite|Request for mediation]] that involves this user. It can't hurt to wait some more time to see the outcome. 
support,Hardworking contributor with a good deal of experience. He may only have registered four months ago but that does not preclude him from adminship. And anyone who makes 1600 edits in four months' time definitely seems devoted to me. 
support,I can't see any issues with his becoming an admin. 
support,Strongly support. 
oppose,But would probably support at a later date with more edits. 
support,Looks good to me. 
support,Rlandmann has my full admiration I would have nominated him had I knew that he&#8217;s still not an administrator. 
support,A definite support. Rlandmann does a LOT of work here especially at for the aviation pages. 
support,Looks solid did not see any signs of trouble 
support,Well if Anthony voted against you then I feel pretty darn safe voting for you. Please do make sure you are familiar with all [[Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines]] especially the [[Wikipedia:Candidates for speedy deletion|speedy deletion policy]]. 
support,Strongly support. 
support,Haven't noticed Rlandmann before but a quick check reveals great contributions courteous and helpful talk page discussions and good work on [[Wikipedia:Copyright problems]]. Definite support. 
support,Seems like an excellent contributor to me. 
support,Yet another data point for my argument that selfnominations are not inferior to "regular" nominations. Just look at all the people above several of whom regularly look for good people to nominate and all of whom overlooked this overqualified contributor. And myself just as guilty as the rest. As my penance I support. 
support,You weren't a sysop already? Oops. 
support,Been here longer than me. Edited more than me. Hasn't gotten into any fights. Isn't an admin yet? Correct this we will. 
support,I thought he was already an administrator. 
support,More Rlandmann please. 
oppose,We shouldn't be deleting mistakes in page names we should be redirecting them. 
support,Wow. I know this is a cliche here on RfA but I really really thought you were already an admin. REALLY! 
support,What Blankfaze said. 
support,An excellent choice I'd have nominated long ago if I'd thought to check. 
support,Certainly. 
support,I didn't know Rmhermen had been around for quite this long but even if I was only considering what I've seen of Rmhermen over the past few months it's quite enough for me to support. 
support,[[User Talk:Texture|&#964;]]
support,Por supuesto. 
support,support. 
support,copious contributor. (Maybe nominations should be switched to the top of this page so they'd be more noticeable.) 
support,I have seen him insert a quality NPOV compromise into a troubled POV debate/altercation regarding a passage and thereby resolve the circumstance. He appears to have just the sort of judicial approach that would dignify adminship with his inclusion. 
support,It's about time and I hope he accepts. 
support,Kind of assumed he already was a sysop. 
support,I think it is safe to assume that Roadrunner hasn't actually seen this nomination yet and possibly doesn't know he has a talk page. In his about 5000 contributions I count 3 edits to User talk pages (and more than 3 to User pages). Lots of edits to regular article Talk pages. 
support,(I thought he was) 
support,I thought that Roadrunner was an admin a year ago!!!!! It's about time! He is one of Wiki's best contributors. 
support,Good edits indeed. 
support,Absolutely 
support,Seems like a thoughtful balanced contributer to me. 
support,the quality is definitely there even if the quantity is low and I think Robin is a very helpful friendly and levelheaded contributor. 
support,(See below). 
support,A quality contributor. Being a sysop elsewhere doesn't automatically make you a sysop here but I trust Robin is familiar with our policies since it's probably been necessary to draw from them in the effort to build the Maori Wikipedia. I also don't expect admins to necessarily be highly active in that capacity so I'm not concerned with how Robin divides time between here and there. 
support,In my experience Robin would be deserving of "important and ponderous privileges" if we had any to offer here in the absence of them I heartily approve of entrusting Robin with the few abilities of an administrator (and their attendant disadvantages). 
support,No big deal. 
oppose,Sorry seems like a genuine and good contributor but far too few edits for me. 
oppose,I'd just like to point out that a person's edits are not and should not be the only factor in adminship decisions. Certainly they are an important indicator but it should be asked as well what a prospective admin will do for Wikipedia. No offense but it seems like Mr. Patterson is quite involved with the Maori Wikipedia and as he himself has stated "may not actually DO anything with the position." Perhaps more people need to view adminship as an important and ponderous privilege rather than a social title. 
support,I've always seen positive contributions and certainly Rob's been here a very long time. 
support,A productive veteran. 
support,Hemayat kardan (support). 
support,[[User Talk:Texture|&#964;]]
support,Reviewed edit history liked what I saw. Seems like a good candidate.

support,Roozbeh has been amazingly calm considering the personal attacks 69.111.53.180 has made against him. 
support,Very much agreed with Angela. 
support,! We need a sysop like him 
oppose,IMHO still needs more experience here. 
support,Was planning on nominating myself once the stats page showed a few more edits. Clearly understands the deletion policy and will follow it with a more literal interpretation instead of the more liberal interpretation of some admins. Also unprovokable and a firm believer in hearing both sides of an issue before taking a stand. 
support,How did we miss this one for so long? [[User:Meelar|
support,Of course. 
support,What Meelar said. 
support,based on Rossami's argument for giving articles time to grow on [[Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Sty]]. 
support,I don't agree with Rossami but I definitely want him/her to be an admin based on the calm clear response I received. [[User Talk:Texture|&#964;]]
support,Anyone who wades through the cesspool of VfD while remaining calm (unlike myself) deserves a support vote. 
oppose,I'm changing my vote. I had initially voted but Rossami's recent contributions to VfD in which he feels that any and all garbage is worth keeping on Wikipedia calls into question his fitness for sysophood. 
oppose,I have to go in the Oppose section since Rossami has not addressed RickK's comment or the comments of supporters who agree with the sentiment. I'd like to see some explanation. Where are the usual questions asked of the admin candidate? [[User Talk:Texture|&#964;]]
support,definitely. Salsa Shark handles vandals extremely well already and has from way back. 
support,I have seen only good contributions from him. 
support,blanks pages and points out vandals would put admin powers to good use. 
support,I have seen Salsa Shark appear frequently on my watchlist making excellent contributions to articles I care about.

support,Solid. 
support,Impressive contributor.

support,Woohoo!

support,Great idea. 
support,I supported Seth last time. I will this time too. 
support,We could use dedicated admins now more than ever. 
support,Seth appears to have a very good understanding of Wikipedia despite his short time here and I think he is more than capable of being a good admin. 
support,Assuming he doesn't intend to refuse this nomination. ;) Excellent editor will make a fine admin. 
support,I have frequently followed him around deleting stuff he has added the delete msg to...so he'd be good for that kind of work for sure! 
support,Already thought he was an admin. 
support,Seems quite helpful hardworking and sympathetic. 
support,Excellent editor and picture finder. 
support,Very good editor. 
support,Seth has a great attitude and work ethic. 
support,Definitely an asset to Wikipedia. 
support,I'm removing my vote to support. Seth Ilys is a very good Wikipedian and I might be better off taking up my nitpicking issues with him on his talk page. 
support,Excellent editor and contributor. 
support,<strike]] 
support,The mere fact that David Cannon is responsible for the nomination lends credence to the user. Reviewed and this seems like a very nice user. 
support,Of course! I've come across he's works quite often and saw only patience and the ability to keep cool even in the midst of heat. I remember when he first came aboard WP he was surprisingly receptive to advices and suggestions. He still is very amicable. In addition to his good rapport with the community he offers us with the excellent and muchneeded English info on the wonderful Korean culture history and geography (basically him and Kokiri are the only people working on that subject now). And the nominator David is somebody whose opinion I trust since I supported him myself as an admin. 
support,I'm not familiar with Sewing but David Cannon's nomination Menchi's comments on his demeanor and Sewing's own actions in notifying users who might oppose his nomination all speak very highly of Sewing. Anyone that honorable has my trust. 
support,I say no more. After reading I am convinced. I support the nomination. 
support,Absolutely. Shallot will make a firstrate admin.

support,Completely agree with Mark. I had actually considered nominating him a few days prior (no really!) but feared his relatively low edit count would be a criticism (one which I do not hold). He does great work. 
support,Checking edit history... hmm further back... further... Mop! Bucket! Keyring! Now! 
support,Man he should be working double shifts with Kingturtle. 
support,At the risk of sounding cliche...whaddayamean he ain't an admin?!? There. Cliche has passed. I still support! 
oppose,Looks like he has the makings of a good admin but I have to have doubts about whether his judgement of article value has developed enough. Short on edits (~1550) with a large number of those spent on VFD and RFA and on very simple fixes. Viewing his contribs and excluding minor edits and all nonarticle namespace edits gives about 500 entries. Those entries are mostly simple "Recent changes" wikify and <nowiki>{{stub}}</nowiki> insertion. Sorting his contribs another way (by article title) shows no longterm committments to any rarely more than 2 edits at most. I would support at 2000 edits if he spent some time away from Recent changes (*gasp*) and worked on the main focus of the project the encyclopedia articles. 
support,I thought he already was an admin! Full support of course. 
support,I do believe Snowspinner is a he. Either way I support. 
support,It's still very early for my tastes (just above my personal minimum) but my interactions with Snowspinner convince me he'll make a fine admin.

After reading in which Snowspinner includes as "evidence" against Avala that Avala opposed Snowspinner's previous nomination here and that Avala nominated a candidate Snowspinner finds unworthy I'm worried that Snowspinner doesn't clearly enough distinguish between his personal opinions and Wikipedia policy and is too likely to see mere differences of opinion as actionable "rule breaking". I say this as someone who also finds Avala difficult and as someone who had planned to vote for Snowspinner both here and for ArbCom. 
oppose,Oppose based on the tendency for confrontation and rash judgement evident on his edits to this page. 
oppose,It is a reluctant opposition and does not reflect any personal feelings I might have toward Snowspinner's past or continuing contributions to the site and project. However I reviewed the evidence against Avala and I felt that there were a number of occasions when an appeal to a broader community might have easily forestalled the animosity. Avala's English is not fluent and he is a citizen of the former Yugoslavia. Consequently some of his arguments were hampered by the language barrier but additionally many of Snowspinner's misunderstandings were caused by not seeking out other more fluent English speakers from the area to help negotiate opinions. After a certain point it seems like the fight was about the fighting and not about any particular issue article or decision. That it reached such a point without outreach without seeking the aid of neutral parties does reflect somewhat poorly on Snowspinner's reactions to a belligerant fellow editor. Finally and ultimately though I feel that Snowspinner's time on Wikipedia is simply too brief. I say this not because I believe there is a magic number of days or edits but because the motivation to move to administrator quickly worries me. If one's desire is based upon getting one's will then it is bad. If one's desire is based upon changing the course of the project that too is bad. If one's desire is to particpate in a social world of admins then I feel the motivation is suspect. Only if the desire is based upon duty and a belief that the project is far more important than any of the project's participants is it appropriate. I do not in any way whatever mean to imply that I believe that Snowspinner's motives are bad. In fact I think Snowspinner is a reasonable intelligent and dilligent contributor to the project who has shown himself of the highest commitment. Instead I oppose because I feel that it takes a great deal of time as a regular user to show a person's continued perseverance and to establish how such a person will react to others in opposition. I do not think there is enough of a track record. Hoping by all means that I offer no offense and provoke only thought 
oppose,I don't think Snowspinner has enough editing experience. Yes he has over 2600 edits but looking at his last 100 contributions there are only about seven edits to articles. He may only have a few hundred article edits altogether. Paradoxically this appears to be the very reason he has received so much support as opposed to the other nominees on this page at least I can find no other explanation (if I'm wrong maybe some who supported Snowspinner but not the others can explain their voting) other than that he is simply better known and this is because the average "Wikipedia:" page is more widely read than the average article (and article edits are not signed). I find it troubling however that this way we tend to create a class of "professional sysops" who are merely supervising the actual editors who work on the articles. And I note that Snowspinner is already running for the Arbitration Committee which I don't see as a good sign. Everyone here should be an editor in the first place and the administrative tasks should be shared among editors not entrusted to a separate class who does little else but administrating. 
support,Nominator. 
support,Not an admin?!?! Extreme support! 
support,[[User:MacGyverMagic|
support,but aren't we all [[Solipsist]]'s sockpuppets?
support,Easy decision. 
support,Of course. 
support,I'd oppose based on the corny intellectual humor on his user page but I've been guilty of similar offenses a few times. 
support,I personally find the userpage humor funny but I'm weird like that. 
support,Seems levelheaded and judicious. 
support,Dangit I thought you were an admin already! 
support,seems to be wellliked. 
support,We could use more admins like Solipsist. [[User:Rhymeless|
support,Hard working intelligent and plays along when I leave notes on his/her talk page asking whether I am a fictional creation in the universe Solipsist alone inhabits or Solipsist is a fictional creation in my solitary universe. Just the right combination of whimsy and wit to make an excellent admin 
support,(insert your favourite cliché here) 
support,[[User:JonMoore|
support,Is there a way we can make a list of these people who somehow keep going unnoticed? Solipsist is in my opinion one of the very best!

support,[[|Arch beam (structure) column console]]. 
support,Kind of young account but good work! 
support,Ooh look a bandwagon I want on! But seriously good work has definately shown his worth. 
support,obviously. 
support,If nothing else Solipsist has the craziest electronic signatures on all of Wikipedia! Anyone who dons the virtual Groucho glasses while maintaining the integrity of this site is OK by me. 
support,I see no reason to oppose. 
support,Productive indeed. 
support,Uploads nice images.
support,[[user:zanimum]] Despite a reluctancy brought on by never hearing of him until now I can't find any major criticism of him. Good work on the number of edits. 
support,A reasonable and pragmatic contributor amenable to discussion. 
support,Just one niggle: when you become an admin ssd you should probably refrain from deleting stuff from Talk pages not that I mind because I can see that your intentions are honest and you are just trying to save space but it sets a bad example for others. 
support,"I thought he was one already." (I know I know how unoriginal can one get :P 
support,Coped well with Lir on DNA and has made some great contributions. 
support,anyone who can get Angela and Lir both to like them must have something extraordinary. This I got to see! 
support,Absolutely. A perfect fit for the job. 
support,[[User Talk:Texture|&#964;]]

support,Son we'll give you the job if you cut your hair and put on some decent clothes. Just kidding I wholeheartedly support. 
support,Excellent work all around. 
support,Süppørt ;) 
support,I've seen good work. 
support,will make a great sysop. 
support,I'm normally wary of selfnominations but I think Sverdrup is one of The Overlooked those so clearly qualified for sysophood that we forget they aren't one already. 
support,100% support. 
support,Have no problem supporting 
support,Total support. I'm only sorry that you had to nominate yourself one of us should have done it. 
support,Strange that he wasn't one already. 
support,Um I really thought this guy was an admin. 
support,Edit history looks solid to me. 
support,In that case (see comments) I support. 
support,I too am surprised that he is not an admin already. for a dedicated and involved editor. 
support,Absolutely. I was planning to nominate him myself. 
support,So was I. . Knows his way around here active on RC patrol and VfD and copyvios welcomes new users. His help would be an asset. 
support,Agree with Blankfaze. Certainly then. 
support,Weren't you already an admin? 
support,What says below in comments. Shows a good understanding of the difference between speedy and VfD material. 
support,Responsible contributions on VfD are a big plus. 
support,Mhmm. 
support,Of course. 
support,[[User:Bobdoe|
support,Thoughtful VfD contributions are as important as content creation. 
support,I've seen him around no problems that I know of. Time on VfD isn't a problem; someone needs to do it and people who do that kind of community and maintainance work will make more use of the admin functions anyway. Maybe he'll help with the backlog. 
support,Very much so. 
support,I have to echo many others when I say "He isn't already an admin?" He certainly has the qualities that a good admin needs. 
support,Yes! In my experience SWAdair is thoughtful pleasantly communicative and certainly has shown interest in janitorial duties. As Isomorphic said of VfD someone needs to do it; I think such good faith commitment to behindthescenes maintenance should be lauded rather than criticised. 
support,Of course. I don't see why his activity on VFD is a problem when we have people complaining about those who don't edit anywhere but the main namespace when they are nominated. 
support,Anyone with a name good enough to fool me to believe he/she is actually involved with [[Swiss International Airlines]] is good enough to be an administrator here. Besides I have seen his contributions and this contributor is "going high places" "
support,Great person to deal with. "
support,Yep. 
support,Indeed. 
support,Definitely. 
support,very active on VFD. 
support,Not an admin yet?? Hmmm. 
support,assumed already was one. Hardly a deletionist brought [[General Maritime Corporation]] to my attention as needing to be turned into a proper article rather than taking it to VfD<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Niteowlneils/Archive1#GENERAL_MARITIME_CORPORATION>. Shows an interest in keeping Wikipedia tidy and good judgement of what is encyclopedic two of the most important qualifications for an admin IMHO. According to the comments of some of those opposed (and neutral even) I should be deadmined as I almost never add content but spend almost all my time on 'housekeeping' which I believe is sorely needed<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Village_pump#Category:Years_in_fashion>. Wikipedia has plenty of "writers" contributing 6 word articles (and poorly translated articles that make little sense to a native English speaker) and direly needs more "janitors". 
support,[[User:Dpbsmith|
support,Looks good to me. I also appreciate anyone who takes the time to volunteer in the slums of VfD. 
oppose,VFD regular (well over 1/3 of his edits) and an extreme deletionist. I don't see any effort to contribute just a desire to remove content. Anyone that has such a desire to regularly remove content (and uses the insulting label "fancruft") doesn't show enough respect for fellow contributors work and granting the ability to more easily remove content would be illplaced here. "Janitors" are fine and all but this site also needs writers. () 
oppose,I have found that 1/5 (407) of this user's total (2104) edits were with the Wikipedia:Votes for deletion. As well a little under 1/2 (1003 out of 2104) of the edits were actually edits not on articles meaning the other 1/2 were on articles. I will vote to oppose for the time being. See comments for my figures. 
oppose,I do believe someone with such a long record on VFD isn't the best possible admin material. Administrators contributions should clearly concentrate on writing new stuff so they have not only the experience of writing new stuff but the idea of what it feels like for the person whose job is being wrecked when its deleted. This would make our administrators not only more professional but better in human issues as well. 
oppose,The history indicates that the user is too deletionist and not bent enough towards fixing articles rather than doing VfD politics instead. Admittedly a political vote. No to deletionism. 
support,I come accross Taxman and his work every so often and this guy has left a good impression on me. A courteous and diligent worker who is a real asset to Wikipedia. 
support,but please make sure vandal hunting doesn't take too much of your time I like your ideas on referencing and peer review much better. [[User:MacGyverMagic|
support,Yes. 
support,Certaintly. 
support,I thought he was an admin actually. Seems like a good guy. 
support,I've seen so much good from Taxman. I had no idea he isn't an admin! 
support,Taxman's work on Sealand was a model. Wholeheartedly support.
support,Strong We may not always agree but he's made some fine contributions. He's also a man of principle. 
support,Yet another case where I am utterly surprised as to the candidate's real user level status. . 
support,Sure. 
support,One taxman I wouldn't mind paying. :P 
support,NOT AN ADMIN? WHAT? ;) 
support,Should've nominated him myself. 
support,Not aware of trouble and meets my [[Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Standards|standards]].
support,Taxman is very taxing on [[Wikipedia:Featured article candidates]] but I think that's a good thing 
support,An invaluable asset to the WP. 
support,Never really noticed you before but after lookingthrough your contributions I see I should have. This is a good example of why we maybe need some mechanism for 'automatically noticing' good editors long overdue for adminship. Thanks for noticing yourself and being bold enough to selfnominate. Surprised that you aren't listed as a member at [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Fact and Reference Check|factcheck]]. Your list interests me how was it compiled? 
support,A good user worthy of adminship despite his username giving me nightmares. ;) 
support,You have my vote [[User:Squash|
support,Has been alert and careful in spotting vandalism. 
support,participates in lots of general maintenance. Is involved heavily in VfD. It would help him and us if he could delete VfD results too.
support,solid and positive contributor. 
support,Doing a great job already. 
support,Has been helpful to new users. 
oppose,Considers trolling humour. 
oppose,Ok I hope I don't upset anyone by putting my two cents in. In a recent disagreement with I agreed with Texture. However constant reverting of [[Votes for deletion]] was not the way to handle the dispute. I like Texture but he seems easy to bait into silly actions. 
support,Of course. 
support,STRONGEST SUPPORT EVER. More than 7000 edits and 300 articles to his name in less than three months. One of the best contributors to come through Wikipedia in a while. 
support,Edit history looks good. Talked with him too. I support. 
support,Definitely. To the extent that Wikipedia is a soap opera what better man to document it. For those not getting the joke Mike has tirelessly documented almost the entire US soap opera subculture and to a great extent has done so with succumbing to the temptation to "breakout" irrelevances that we see in [[Pokémon|some other]] [[Star Wars|popular culture subjects]]. 
support,EXCELLENT. 
support,I also support Mike's evil twin brother Hank who (when he regains his lost memory and returns from Darkest Peru intending to frame Mike for his own murder) would also make an excellent (if evil) admin. 
support,Good edits good articles good person. I've been talking to him a lot recently. Good soap opera edits. Maybe if I revamp ATWT I could have a similar honor... ;) 
support,Absolutely. 
support,[[User:Frazzydee|
support,Absolutely unquestionably and enthusiastically support. I cannot adequately express my enthusiasm about this guy. Mike is a responsible knowledgeable hardworking and highly motivated user. He's also one helluva nice person who cares deeply about this project its people and its success. We need more Mikes! 
support,Certainly. He would use it responsibly and politely. [[User:Meelar|
support,For sure. 
support,Speaking as one of the only real wikipedia contributors to have had a conflict with Mike (over what was essentially an administrative misunderstanding) I feel that I am uniquely qualified to say that I support his nomination with no reservations whatsoever. In his time here he has proven himself to be a prolific contributor and will no doubt be a great administrator with the best intentions for Wikipedia at all times. Congrats Mike!. 
support,Very much so. 
support,To beat the Rfa cliche further into the ground "He isn't an admin already?" 
support,What they said. 
support,I have not greater pleasure than to endorse the nomination of Mike. A perfect user; expert in his field polite cooperative and humourous. 
support,Dedicated editor will be good admin 
support,[[User Talk:Texture|&#964;]]
support,Strongly support would make a fine admin. 
support,Great contributor. 
support,I give my support. [[User:Poccil|
support,Mike was very welcoming to me and worked out a good compromise to my complaints that he wasn't including PBS in his network TV schedules. I think he will have a lot of good to contribute. 
support,Absolutely! I'm so glad he accepted the nomination. He'll be an entirely advantageous addition to the cabal. ;) 
support,Mike is a good guy lacking any particularly strong opinions but perfectly trustworthy with the keys to the Closet. 
support,[[User talk:Ilyanep|(T&alpha;l&kappa;)]] 00:49 2 Sep 2004 (UTC) Woah...I forgot to add my name. Wholehardedly support. 
support,Most violently support!

support,I hereby declare my support for Mike H as an admin :D 
support,I suppose at this point my vote is a mere formality... 
support,So long as his uni work doesn't suffer... 
support,oh yes! 
support,a little odd but a good guy! 
support,He's a nice guy even though he does look down on RfA selfnoms. 
support,Very much support. One of the things I very much enjoy at WP is it's a place where all kinds of people may contribute what they know. Mike and I have a quality about ourselves that others tend to despise a mind predisposed to trivia. We have different fields of interest but the more the better! He's a constructive caring guy (though I've never previously told him that in any prior communication) Mike deserves our full support and may many more like him come as well. 
support,Seems reliable and rsponsable. Always seems to be around. Fair play to the man.
support,He has good Wikipedia sense and will be good with adminship. 
support,By now this is a mere formality but he certainly has my vote as well. 
support,He has my vote certainly. 
support,I think Mike has the project's best intentions at heart. 
oppose,He wants to speedy delete perfectly legitimate stubs on no other basis than they "get on his turf" he thinks he somehow owns the entire soap opera section of the encyclopaedia. When I removed the speedy delete tags he told me: "I think removing these tags is really counterproductive and it aggravates me to no end. Personally this guy is causing much trouble for me and my work and you're just aiding him. <...> I work in this section. I've written probably 100 (or more) legitimate articles on soap actors that I'm quite proud of. When I see things like this it undermines the work I have done and I feel like I am obligated to clean them up to bring them up to my other articles. Sure I don't HAVE to but let's be honest would you like someone shitting on things you liked to do?" I replied: "That doesn't make any sense. First of all factual stubs are in no way "shitting". How do they undermine your work on different articles? You are not obligated at all at improving them. You're not responsible for the entire section of soap actors." Whereupon he said: "Apparently you're just not choosing to get how I feel about it so there's no use talking about it anymore." Apparently he thinks his "feelings" should be the law of Wikipedia. 
oppose,Oppose. Sorry but the whole attitude towards substubs/stubs/ incompetent users does not befit an administrator. 
support,[[User:Meelar|
support,According to the best of my knowledge and belief Tillwe will be a useful and good admin. 
support,Thought he/she already was an admin!

support,Absolutely support. 
support,Sure he sounds responsible and probably won't go loco like so many others have.

support,good admin material.

support,What General Patton said. 
support,[[User:Aranel|
support,Adds good content interested in administration (as demonstrated by his thoughtful discussion on how best to implement the AOTW idea) and generally good guy. 
support,Sounds excellent. He'll be a good one. 
oppose,Nothing personal here. I simply don't think Tom has enough experience in the community yet. I will definitely support in a few months if his track record continues. 
oppose,I too feel this is premature. Tom does not yet meet the I try to follow when voting here and I share Kingturtle and Angela's sentiments.

support,Swell user.

support,Strongly support.
support,[[User Talk:Texture|&#964;]]
support,slightly tentatively but I think he can be trusted with admin powers. 
support,I find it amazing that he isn't already one and it would be one of the many examples of a bad decision by majority rule if he isn't promptly voted in. 
support,Cautiously support. 
support,His comments below seem reasonable and what I've seen from him was good. And I trust the judgement of those who voted in support before me. 
support,UninvitedCompany's comments are good enough for me. I'll add that I think admin status should depend on length of stay and quality of contributions but not on frequency of visits. 
support,Although I'm against the use of multiple accounts I still feel that UC would make a good admin. Therefore I support. 
support,Low activity levels are not a reason to withold administrator status. 
support,I don't see any problem with the change of user name and I don't see any problem with the activity level. Comments below and elsewhere seem to indicate UninvitedCompany is a thoughtful reasonable person. 
oppose,Not active enough. 500 edits in over six months? That's less than 3 per day. And what does Martin mean with "under this account" does he have another? 
oppose,Sorry not nearly active enough. | [[User talk:Finlay McWalter | Talk]] 22:16 18 Apr 2004 (UTC) I opposed Aplank on the grounds that his maintaining multiple accounts that didn't clearly say they all related to the same person was dishonest. It would be hypocritical of me to fail to oppose this user who also has multiple undeclared personae. 
oppose,Concerned about activity levels. 
support,Pleasure to be the first vote. Lots of very helpful edits good communication and I like the answers to the candidate questions. 
support,I nominated him. Does that make my vote redundant? 
support,Over 4000 edits in two languages? Wow. Besides we always need more vandal fighters. 
support,I've never seen this guy before but his 2wiki editing impresses me enough. [[User:Rhymeless|
support,Seems a good user. 
support,Having an admin that can speak 2 languages is quite a useful thing I think. 
support,A wonderful choice and one I should have thought to nominate earlier! 
support,Let's see what's that line... "Thought he already was one." I've never seen anything but good from him. 
support,He's not?? I'm shocked and appalled. 
support,Has done a lot of work welcoming newcomers.

support,Ok. 
support,This guy is known to leap into a justcreated article and make grammar and punctuation corrections. Definitely the kind of dedication we want to see. 
support,I came here to nominate him dammit! 
support,Yes! Friendly willing to discuss and works hard.

Here is an example: <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Violetriga&diff=7007294&oldid=7004390 This> is what he said when an anon put him on "final warning" about removing the anon's votes. Very very very strongly support. 
support,Wonderful. 
support,contributions speak for themselves user page content is not a criteria for adminship. 
support,Looks good. 
support,Very much so. 
support,What Shane King said. . 
support,Of course. 
support,Good articles great person! 
support,All of my previous issues (see [[user_talk:Cynical|my talk page]] for details) were cleared up by the Violetriga. Emphatic . 
support,Wikipedia is littered by Violet's good edits. 
support,Most definitely yes. 
support,This user seems to be everything I would wish from an admin. The user appears to have a clear head civility in the face of anger participates in the community pages and adds contributions to articles as well. What more can we ask from an admin? I offer my strong support. 
support,Excellent candidate for adminship. 
support,Yup valuable asset to Wikipedia. 
support,Has been a complete pleasure to work with. Name suggests Estonian background? 
support,Full support from me. 
support,Purely to offset 216.153.214.94 but I'm sure you're qualified 
support,Strong candidate. 
support,Gotta support those annoying users... 
support,I'll support. We disagreed on one occasion but Visorstuff was very communicative about the whole thing and it was a positive experience overall the type of person who ought to be an admin. 
support,It looks we're on a kick to nominate admins for the religion sections. Perhaps it's good to do a bunch at the same time so they can monitor each other as well. Not that I foresee any problems from this crew just that the presentation of religious subjects has a high risk of provoking people. We need admins to help each other tread carefully. 
support,Working together was constructive and educational for me. 
support,He doesn't have vvery many edits but that can be a good thing (he doesnt get into edit wars etc). 
support,Not a vote but I just wanted to point out that you don't need to be an admin to help new users. 
support,What he's not an admin yet? 
support,but I'd like to see you answer the generic admin questions. 
support,Strong community presence. 
support,This is one of the "how is he not an admin yet?" ones. 
support,I've seen good work particularly the illustrations. 
support,I agree with Michael. 
support,! 
support,never thought I'd say this but ... He is not an admin yet??? 
support,Hard worker. Good guy. ([[User_talk:Quadell|talk]]) (
support,Agreed. 
support,You mean he isn't already? 
support,Most surely.

support,Good contributor to political and geographical articles. 
support,Valued contributor does a lot of unglamorous work. 
support,SUpport. 
support,I've never had the pleasure of bumping in to Wernher but judging by the edit history a valuable asset to WP. Lots of good copy editing all editsummarised. 
support,Sure I'm happy to support. 
support,I'm in support as well. 
support,I support the candidate as I know Wernher for the nitpicker he is 
support,As someone who campaigns constantly for accurate edit summaries by trying to lead by example I can't but support Wernher. 
support,I heartily support Wernher's candidacy 
support,Great nomination. 
support,Anyone with this many edits and no controversies must be a good user. 
support,Went through a bit of Wernher's contribution history just now & what I saw seemed solid & appropriately tidy w/o any obvious and untimely controversies. Seems like a solid candidate to me... 
support,This is exactly the type of editor I feel strongly deserves adminship 
support,Wesley is an excellent contributor. 
support,support. 
support,Need more consensus builders 
support,He is able to work on articles concerning religion and not get into edit wars name calling or arguments. A model citizen with a keen eye. 
support,He uses talk pages how they were designed. Works well to build consensus. 
support,Excellent work 
support,Way overdue. Excellent sense of judgment on religon a notoriously difficult realm to be neutral about. 
support,Respects what makes WP great. 
support,no question. 
support,[[User Talk:Texture|&#964;]]
support,Good contributor. 
support,About 600 article name space edits but high quality math stuff including major contributions. Also active on [[VfD]] 
support,Wikipedia is not Kingturtle's exclusive country club.

support,Definitely a solid edit history. 
support,Nice work in crypto. 
support,Great contribs to (at least) cryptography articles; has always been exemplarily polite and reasonable when I've had disagreements over articles with him. 
support,Great crypto editor. 
support,The little I've encountered Ww I've been impressed. Good choice. 
support,Don't know him personally but edit history seems good. 
support,Solid. 
support,Strongly support. Wikipedia's crypto section needs work and Ww has done quite a bit of it. 
support,To have been here that long with that many contributions and yet I've never seen him work tells me two things one we must either have different interests or else his edits are minor and two he must not get into trouble. And with that many edits without trouble I can't see not supporting this candidate. 
support,I've certainly seen him around the Wiki. I haven't ever seen him involved in any problems or disputes so I support. 
support,Jwrosenzweig says it better than I. 
support,Very worthy support. 
support,He is around here for ages; should definitely be an admin. 
support,Definitely support. And I note editing from the [[PRC]] as well... 
support,for sure. He is very responsive when you bring up matters with him and he tries his best to get to the bottom of the issue if possible. 
support,Very responsive and responsible. 
support,Solid edit history. 
support,He seems friendly and trustworthy I don't see him getting into too many edit wars or anything of the sort. 
support,If Gboy = Yacht then support. 
support,Very friendly in tough edit climates. 
support,of course. Great editor. 
support,WP need more people like him. 
support,If people engage in edit wars with him he can now protect the page and make the needed changes. 
support,Zero has a hard edge that he would do well to remediate. I disagree with some of his writings but that is not what this is about. I'm impressed with his intelligence and skill and would like to hear an expression from him that he would "count to ten" before crafting his talk responses and admin duties. So cautiously support. 
support,Valuable contributor support 
support,though I think he will need to be careful not to use admin powers in articles he is involved with. 
support,Fully we need people who know middle eastern history! 
support,if he can write neutrally on the Middle East. On the other hand given my Jewish heritage I must question MY OWN ability to write neutrally on that subject. ) 
support,[[User Talk:Texture|&#964;]]
support,I've looked over some of his article edits and some talk page edits. Seems knowledgeable about subjects that really need someone knowledgeable. Doesn't appear to have an agenda. I don't see that he has any problems communicating with other editors. 
support,Good enough record all things considered 
support,Sure why not. 
support,He's a good contributor. 
oppose,Too many edit wars. I feel this user is contentious. 
oppose,I get a bad feeling about this person. He was a very emotional and nonconsiderate arguer: [[Talk:Permutation]] 
oppose,Agreed with Kingturtle and Hfastedge. 
oppose,Oppose. I appreciate his attention to detail as well as his knowledge and writting talent in his major areas of contribution as do those that support him but adminship has nothing to do with that nor will adminship or lack thereof effect his ability to perform in these areas. The skills that are relevant to adminship are interpersonal communication and critical thinking. I am not confident with him in these respects in concurrence with the assesments of those above. See for example [[Talk:Permutation]] 
oppose,Oppose. Involved (rightly or wrongly) in lots of edit wars and such. We need admins who are upstanding noncontroversial wikipedians regardless of what swell guy people think he is. 
oppose,Neutral but I do want to say that I think has it quite wrong. 
oppose,Has a highly specialized editing pattern and Too new. http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Special:Contributions&hideminor=0&target=Zero0000&limit=500&offset=0 
oppose,Hmmm.....I've heard good things about Zero0000 but everytime I've seen him in action I see a user who seems to be working behind the scenes to "rally troops" and coordinate efforts in order to win edit wars/discussions. Now I know that can happen for innocent reasons (sometimes a troll needs to be handled collectively) but it makes me nervous to see it as what I perceive to be a natural state of affairs for Zero. I'd like to see some examples of cool and calm behavior? I can see myself being convinced but I need more than normal "great guy" comments to commit I'd like it if both sides pointed to instances. Thanks. 
support,8500 edits? Of course I support. 
support,support good editor this kind is the meat and potatoes of wikipedia.
support,Kleggetch sounds Yiddish. 
support,I'm glad to support we need more people who are here to do good work and aren't interested in battles. 
support,I fail to see how picking a few fights so that you can be "tested" would improve wikipedia for anyone. If picking fights makes people "tested" we need more untested admins and users. 
support,Good work 
support,[[User:GRider|
support,Zoney is a great contributor and fun to work with. 
support,Good user. 
support,[[User Talk:Texture|&#964;]]
support,Agree with Ludraman. 
support,I know you... 
support,Good contributor will make good admin 
support,Second John Collison's thought above. The Zonester will serve Wikipedia well! He also shows curiosity about topics outside his native Ireland he's dialogued with me about California transportation topics in [[Ridge Route]] and added to that article by his questions. 
support,Blah blah support blah blah leprechaun blah I can't believe he's not an admin already! 
support,Blah blah support what he said. 
support,[[User:Noisy|
support,Yeah yeah let's get on with the [[Special:Makesysop]]... 
support,Not a huge contributor but knows what he's doing and has demonstrated impartiality and calmness in POV disputes. 
support,Agreed. 
support,Adam seems to know what he's doing; the fact that he's been with the project for 12 years is a plus
oppose,You seem like a good guy and I like what you said in your nomination. Please renominate yourself (or remind me to nominate you) when you get to 1000 edits or so. 437 just isn't enough for me. 
oppose,All users should have the ability to revert quickly. 
oppose,I agree with moink and have issues with any request for adminship directed solely at article you edit on. (Else why the reference to "coauthors" that you are seeking admin status?) 
oppose,Not enough edits 
support,Oppose until I see enough evidence that Anárion is not a sockpuppet of Jor. 
support,19:05 8 Sep 2004 (UTC) Er....I like Anarion and would normally have supported but Jor's vote is odd considering it's his first edit in a long while (and that Jor's user page seems to imply he's editing under a different name now). I always liked Jor in the contexts we interacted so this isn't me bashing either Jor or Anarion. I just have to think about this for a while. I've seen enough sockpuppet weird stuff around here that I trust my own judgment to a good extent this just doesn't have the feel of that sort of thing. I trust Anarion and believe that adminship is well deserved. 
support,Neutral > Even if he is a sockpuppet he hasn't been disruptive. Sockpuppets may be "uncool" but Anarion hasn't acted Jorish. 
support,Vote moved from neutral to support. 
support,He's been nice helpful and contributing in the couple topics and discussions I've happened to meet him. 
oppose,I'm not convinced. It doesn't help that Jor votes here suddenly although he hasn't edited articles since April (when his RfA failed and at the very same time Anárion started editing Jor's last article edit (apart from three isolated ones in May) took place on April 23 two hours before Anárion's firstever edit coincidence?). Also Jor's user page makes it clear that he is still editing under another name if that other name isn't Anárion maybe Jor could tell us what it is. This again is given the lack of desysopping procedures too much of a risk. It is also interesting that Anárion made about half his edits in the last week only and they're almost all defacto minor edits though not always marked as such. As to Jor he clearly holds Nazisympathetic views like this expressed on [[Talk:Erika Steinbach]]: "A peace treaty was made impossible because Poland's allies immediately declared war on Nazi Germany and it is rather pointless to speculate what might have been had England not taken the invasion of Poland as an excuse to declare war on their economic rival." 
oppose,Agree with 172. 
oppose,I've been asked to review the technical evidence regarding any connection between Jor and Anárion. Although their most recently used IP addresses don't match their interests appear to be very similar. I think I'd prefer to step on the side of caution. 
oppose,I think this is like an "inverse court" where you are guilty until proved otherwise. Since the evidence above definitely brings doubt I also oppose. Anarion please don't take it personally. I am not saying you are a NeoNazi. I am just saying that this is one of the possible explanations of the facts above and until this is ruled out without doubt I oppose giving you administrator priviledges. If you are interested in the good of Wikipedia you should agree that caution should be first even if that principle hurts you personally. 
support,I support. 
support,Without expressing my opinion on the truth of 's allegation (which coming from him is quite amusing I will say that I don't think it matters: even if Anarion is who he's accused of being he has been a model editor and has avoided the problems that brought his alleged former account into disrepute. If he should change his behavior upon becoming an admin well we have a new Arbitration Committee and some established precedents for dealing with powerabusing admins. Therefore I cautiously support him for adminship. 
support,Agree with Charles P. well spoken. 
support,I would support Anarion or Jor. 
support,Consider Anárion supported. [[User:Rhymeless|
support,Geez if this guy's sockpuppet has >2000 edits his normal account must be or something... 
support,Aye. 
support,Of course I support. He should have been an administrator last time. 
support,Like ugen said. Anyway Anarion is a great contributor. 
support,mainly opposing the unexpained opposition. sockpuppetry is not a valid accusation against a user with so many edits. I will change to oppose only if offensive edits by this user are shown. 
support,I don't care who he really is. If this account has been active since April and hasn't caused any trouble I'm willing to support. 
support,Looking over the other votes I have a strong [[gut feeling]] that I should support. 
support,No reason not to and he's been doing a lot of maintenance. 
oppose,See last nomination. Nothing has changed. 
oppose,Agree with Gzornenplatz. 
oppose,Agree with Gzornnenplatz. 
support,[[User:Meelar|
support,Prefer if it was possible for people (in general) to see deleted articles. 
oppose,No no no no no no. Maybe when hell freezes over. This user has repeatedly gotten in trouble for trolling. So I suppose we should set a good example and reward it by making him an admin. 
oppose,If Anthony does not desire to be an admin for any purpose other than to view deleted articles and he is able to use Kate's tool mentioned below to do so then I see no reason to give him admin status. 
oppose,Why does Anthony merit this unusual treatment? Vfd has become a scary place. 
oppose,Strongly oppose. This request requires monitoring and enforcement and further taxes the time of other Wikipedia editors. There is no reason for a user to deserve this kind of unusual treatment and it would create a bad precedent leading to other even more unusual requests.
oppose,No. I'm happy for a compromise to go ahead along these lines but not involving giving him adminship. Why can't he use Kate's tool? 
oppose,Definitely no. Anthony has a difficult time resolving his perspective with group consensus and often seems not to care if his comments go unexplained and merely appear contrary. I do not think we have any basis for believing we can even understand what this arrangement would mean to him or how he may try to rationalize any kind of action under it later. It would just mean a monitoring headache and endless circular arguments over what exactly was agreed to. 
oppose,I can't in good conscience vote to support something like this. 
oppose,No for many reasons. McFly is a distraction that doesn't further any Wikipediarelated purpose. Anthony DiPierro has made a pest of himself on numerous occasions here and does not respect limits or community. And offering deleted material to a mirror for republication may create problems for us particularly since it includes copyright violations. 
oppose,I am often editing Supreme Court case articles so maybe my views are a little twisted but I can see this vote as nothing more than a precedent and it would be a bad one in my opinion. While I often support new ideas exceptions should be made for exceptional Wikipedians. I have not seen anything from this user to think that he should be made an exception to any rule. I'm sorry. 
oppose,Oppose.
oppose,VERY VERY VERY VERY STRONGLY OPPOSE. 
oppose,[[User:Bobdoe|
oppose,Strongly oppose. Anthony has shown a pattern of agreeing to cease trollish behavior then starting right back up again after a little time has passed. I don't doubt that he would pull the same sorts of shenanigans if he was given admin privileges and "promised" not to use them for anything other than viewing deleted articles. 
oppose,WHEN HELL FREEZES OVER. NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER NEVER. Anthony should not get special rights. 
oppose,Under no circumstances whatsoever should this user be given any rights as admin; I would however be supportive of an indefinite ban. 
oppose,So far no comment or acceptance from Anthony DiPierro or did i just miss it? In any case the tool mentioned below should be enough for his needs 
oppose,I have to vote no. Though I would definetly like to commend the users who decided on bringing this matter before the community rather than making a decision behind the scenes. I also have no objections to Kate Turner's technocratic solution. 
support,Specifically considering [[Wikipedia:administrators|administrators' rights and responsibilities]] I cannot see how the Ceqli question is relevant at all; all the more so in view of the dubious vote counting that first led to the deletion of that page. 
support,I don't find the Ceqli business to be particuarly troublesome. I believe what BRG was getting at is that whenever we create an article we're in fact "promoting" that subject. Since we tend to create articles we know about we tend to promote what's important to us by simply editing. I see no problem with holding that view it seems logical to me. 
support,Agree with Ar and Shane King. 
oppose,has used Wikipedia for the promotion of [[Ceqli]] a minor [[Constructed language|conlang]]. Leaving aside the question of the notability of Ceqli promotion of any kind is quite inappropriate for an administrator. For reference: some of my remarks <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_undeletion&diff=6451274&oldid=6451112> and some of his <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Votes_for_undeletion&diff=6703340&oldid=6702230> concerning Ceqli. 
oppose,15:57 18 Nov 2004 (UTC) Unfortunately the "there is no rule against promoting things" argument for promoting causes worries me. I usually don't care if someone utters a dirty word or gets frustrated but the more dangerous thing to me is the belief that a real life cause must be supported and fought in our pages. 
oppose,Why does that [[Ceqli]] link look blue to me? Don't tell me it got through VfU. Oppose and relist [[Ceqli]] on VfD if that's what it takes. 
oppose,The Ceqli business is troubling and he seems rather ambivalent about becoming an admin. 
oppose,I too find the whole affair with Ceqli an unsettling reflexion on how this user will operate as an admin. 
oppose,Too interested in promoting his own agenda. 
oppose,/
oppose,I wasn't aware of this Ceqli business. Oppose. 
oppose,Candidate attributes opposition to him to a "cabal". We don't need paranoid administrators. 
oppose,No. No no no. No. 
oppose,Anyone who honestly and sincerely thinks a cabal exists does not need to be an administrator. Also see [[Wikipedia:Don't disrupt Wikipedia to illustrate a point]]. 
support,A wikipedian who knows how to use the summary box make him a sysop quick! 
support,My experience with Calmypal has been very positive. 
oppose,Oppose because of the mess/edit wars that happened at [[Template:Uspresidents]] ([[MediaWiki talk:Uspresidents|talk]]). 
oppose,User says about himself: "He is currently King of the Sovereign Nation of Paxania a micronation contained within his own home." We don't need more of this type. 
oppose,While it's nice to have hyperimaginative folks such as yourself around and I personally find your antics entertaining I think boring people tend to make better sysops. 
oppose,Not enough experience yet with the community. 
oppose,Oppose strongly. After he unilaterially added the USpresidents footer he readded it despite having no consensus to do so and commented "As long as you can keep removing it I can keep adding it". His comments at [[MediaWiki talk:Uspresidents]] indicate that he is either dumb or trolling. He did <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=MediaWiki_talk:Uspresidents&diff=2825009&oldid=2824966 this> after being criticized for signing his name as "wikipedia". 
oppose,Oppose due to controversiality reasons indicated below. 
oppose,Too eccentric and unpredictable in my opinion to make a reliable admin at this time. 
oppose,Tends to get into the middle of edit wars. Not to mention the ice cream fiasco and interesting signatures. 
oppose,Oppose. Much too green. 
oppose,Oppose. He does not seem to understand how the deletion process works (see [[Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Winter Sonata|WP:VFD/Winter Sonata]] and recent history for [[Winter Sonata]] and [[Winter Sonata (drama)]]) or what vandalism is (see his [[User talk:Chan Han Xiang|talk page]]). I'm also disturbed at his stridency on a subject he clearly doesn't understand at [[Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style (Japanrelated articles)]] (note that many of his comments there are unsigned). 
oppose,Oppose. Maybe after he has a better understanding of GFDL requirements (move vs. cut/paste to retain history) the definition of vandalism etc. I'm sure he's well intentioned but he is currently insufficiently knowledgeable about the administrative side of things for me to support. 
oppose,Oppose strongly. Chan Han Xiang has developed a pattern of insulting other users as well as threatening them. Just one sentence from [[User talk:Gtabary]]: I tell you dog do a proper article on [[Johor Jaya]] since you act those things as a barrier for comment or you'll be blocked.. Even after being advised about the inappropriateness of it he's used [[WP:VIP]] to list other another editor with whom he is having an editing disagreement. He has changed other editors' signed comments (see <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia%3AVotes_for_deletion%2FMedical_Specialist_Centre&diff=8118050&oldid=8118015http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia%3AVotes_for_deletion%2FMedical_Specialist_Centre&diff=8118050&oldid=8118015>). He has created spurious entries on [[WP:VfD]] out of spite. He still hasn't figured out how to use "show preview" or <nowiki></nowiki>. I don't get any sense that he understands how the social structure here is supposed to work. He threatened me ("DO NOT UTTER RUBBISH. I DEMAND YOU TO RESTORE THE VFD OR I BLOCK YOU.") when one of his spurious VfD entries had simply expired with a consensus to keep. I do appreciate how hard he's been working but he needs to learn better how to get along with others here. 
oppose,Oppose. Maybe another time. 
oppose,A very hard worker but I think his attitude towards other users is seriously lacking for a potential sysop. 
oppose,Oppose very strongly. User reverted my edit to this page and does not understand Wikipedia policies. 
oppose,What David Cannon said. 
oppose,Oppose for now. Not only do I second David Cannon's comments here but the intent to delete 'substubs' has me worried. I see substubs as potentially good articles not 'speedy' material. 
support,of course! I wanted to nominate him for adminship almost three months ago! 
support,I've read over the contretemps (see below). It seems irrelevant to the question of whether chocolateboy will misuse admin privileges. 
support,sorry to disagree with some others whose opinions I generally respect. Yes discussions with Chocolateboy have gotten heated in the past even over seemingly pointless trivia and yes his tone can be agressive. But he takes the time to argue his cases in talk pages without reverting to name calling or what I would call verbal abuse and in my opinion he brings up strong and good arguments. Ultimately he has also stepped down on issues such as the [[Miss Kitty Fantastico]] "chocolate box" link. He is passionate but in my judgement based on what I've read of his heated interactions he does not let his passion carry him past the red lines and he is capable of compromise. He strikes me also as intelligent and pedantic in the good sense. I see nothing in his behaviour that leads me to believe he will abuse his administrative powers and I've seen several current administrators who are more argumentative and agressive than this user. 
support,What Cyan said. 
support,What they both said. C'mon! Sysops get in edit wars all the time; as long as they don't abuse their power I'm fine with it. (BTW who the hell is Kitty Fantastico?) 
oppose,Too few edits IMO will possibly support after 2000. 
oppose,Oppose. His ridiculous edit war at [[Miss Kitty Fantastico ]] and abusive posts when questioned about it show he is not admin material. 
oppose,Oppose. Having read the rant I can't support elevating him to admin and feel compelled to act in opposition. (Was that humorless enough?) 
oppose,But can we put the Miss Kitty Fantastico edit war on lamest edit wars ever? 
support,Good nomination. I support. 
support,the user looks as though he started out rough but has made an effort to do good and work things out. I say it is worth a try for this kid. 
support,He has put in his fair share I think he at least deserves a chance. 
support,fully support (I think RickK should be Desysoped for vandalism) This kid looks like he knows what he's doing! 
oppose,You can't be serious. With his aggressive confrontational style and his POV attitude and his refusal to acknowledge the existance of copyrights? Strongly oppose. Not to mention that he hasn't been here long enough. 
oppose,I recall this user incessantly lying about some image on the Al Gore page claiming he had taken it himself when in fact it was identical to a Reuters or AP copyrighted photo. This stubbornness and refusal to collaborate with others leads me to believe he would not be the best person to place in the position of an Administrator. So oppose. 
oppose,I've witnessed Chris do too many rash and irresponsible things in Wikipedia. He has exhibited a short fuse and a harsh lip. I need to see many many months of him practicing good behavior before I can endorse him. 
oppose,Of course not. 
oppose,I was neutral until I was lobbied because it made me believe that Chris isn't yet ready to accept the community's decisions. Perhaps in a while but not now. 
oppose,His statement in support of Zero0000's nomination quoted already by Anthony above shows a serious misunderstanding of our protection policy. 
oppose,Would not have voted but I must agree with Michael Snow and Anthony that that statement is problematic. 
oppose,Mildly oppose. Caveat: the only thing that I know about this user is that he felt the need to spam my talk page with a request for a `yes' vote. 
oppose,I was neutral until reviewing history. His statement supporting Zero0000 is troubling and his user page contains an ad hominem attack. An admin should be experienced respectful and cooperative. Chris is not yet. 
oppose,Oppose 
oppose,Oppose. And I don't like all this campaigning on the tally page and on people's personal pages. 
oppose,Oppose. ChrisDJackson started out as a problem user and over time his actions and style on the Wiki have improved greatly. He's still a bit confrontational last I checked his edit history but he's coming to understand how things are done around here. A few months as a consistently civil and thoughtful WikiCitizen would change my mind but I haven't seen it yet. I'd very much like to see him stick around and improve his style; I think it's very useful for Wikipedia to have contributors who have come around from being difficult to work with at first; it's a testament to the power of the Wikipedia community. Chris seems to have some *very* strong interests and beliefs and even agendas we all do actually and I commend Chris for making his motives and biases very plain; I wish other editors would do the same. Like jwrosensweig below I'd like to see him be involved in defusing disputes rather than instigating them before I could support an adminship nomination. Try again in three or four months. 
oppose,not yet. spammed my talk page (was unknown previously) engages in some rash behavior. note that the "anthony" user is not reliable on this matter as the two vandalize each other. jackson seems likely to become responsible over time. 
oppose,Stongly oppose hasn't been here long enough. 
oppose,Good and promising editor not but ready yet IMO. Many breaks of weeks or longer in editing and many of the 700 edits are from failure to Preview or mark as Minor. Would like to look again in a few months. 
oppose,What Cecropia said. 
oppose,Oppose due largely to insightful comments by Isomorphic below. If this guy has alot of expertise w topics thats great but w his lack of free time and small number of edits its hard to imagine he aught to spend what little time he spends here w the chores of being an admin. Its not ment to be a status symbol or badge of merit but rather an added responsibility. 
oppose,Not enough experience here. 
oppose,Oppose. Not enough experience. 
support,Good user and I must protest the inevitable coming of the marauding edit count warriors. 
support,Last time I said "he has done good work and is more active than most in discussing matters in article talk pages. Good admin material imho" and that seems even more true now. 
support,Opposing based strictly on edit count seems pefectly silly to me. 
support,Overdue. "Too new" he's been here since Sep '02! 
support,Has plenty of experience in time if not edits. 
support,Happy to support now (did I last time? can't remember). 
support,Sure. <nowiki></nowiki> ([[User_talk:Andrevan|talk]])
support,Good nomination. 
support,I don't generally support cruelty to cyborgs but.... ;) 
support,I supported last time too and see no reason to change that. 
support,A low number of edits but they are good. 
support,Would prefer more edits but can hardly oppose in the above respectful company. 
support,I agree with Jfdwolff. 
support,Yo Cy...you got yourself some REAL heavy hitters in your camp. Good enough for me. 
support,I opposed his selfnomination but that was mainly because I'm inherently skeptical of selfnominations. Strongly support. 
support,I don't believe that those who do noncontroversial editing on noncontroversial topics are any less deserving of adminship. 
support,172 you forget the first... I dunno twenty admins who most definitely had less than 1000 edits... 
oppose,Oppose. User has less than 1000 edits. Over 150 of those edits are on his own user page . Also those edits often break down to many edits on one page (looking recently 14 for [[Symbolic combinatorics]] 8 for [[Semiempirical mass formula]]). This user has mostly editted pages on music he likes science fiction and electrical engineering. He has not been involved at all in pages like this one (requests for adminship) votes for deletion or any other page which shows him having much interaction with other Wikipedia users. This is something Johnleemk brought up during his previous selfnomination and I concur with him. We have no idea how he would act as an admin since his interaction has been limited and admin privileges are all about how he deal with interaction. He edits pages in his fields of interest occasionally posts on a discussion page and once in a blue moon has a discussion on a discussion page. Due to his limited number of edits which are on his user page or the same pages multiple times in a small number of fields and his lack of interaction with other users which is what admin power is all about I oppose this nomination. 
oppose,Oppose for the reasons listed above. I've seen nothing that suggests that this person is cut out to be an administrator. The mostly nonsubstantive comments in support of this nomination have done nothing to persuade me to vote in favour. I have to wonder what qualifies a person for a position of authority who has not even interacted with the community in any significant way. The standard should be higher than that. 
oppose,and with only two days left has not accepted the nomination nor answered the candidate questions. Lack of participation on this nomination page makes me very unimpressed. 
oppose,Oppose. Too few edits. 
oppose,While I agree with the arguments above and as under "Neutral" I do not really understand the reasons why people then say they are neutral to the candidacy. :> /
support,Three months lots of edits and involvement in metaissues (VFD etc.). Good enough for me. 
support,Does some great work. 
support,Of course! He seems like a good user to me. Agree with Slowking Man. 
support,I dislike botphobia. 
support,It's good that he's wanting to become an admin because admins are there to chase any vandals who assail the castle that is Wikipedia. I'm not into vandalism. I congratulate all the nominees and I envy them. 
support,plenty of experience. helpful. agreeable. 
support,Seems to be including more edit summaries. The previous lack of summaries was causing me to lean towards a neutral vote. 
oppose,All those album edits are <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:TUFKAT&diff=prev&oldid=8762788 generated programatically> not handedited and no source is given for the album cover images. Almost all of their edits lack [[Wikipedia:Edit summary|edit summaries]] which are important for communication. Very little (any?) time spent doing any routine maintenance. The communication aspect is most important because without it I don't know much about how they'd be as a sysop. For instance as of writing user has only <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3AContributions&target=DCEdwards1966&hideminor=0&namespace=3 9 edits on other user talk: pages>. Sorry. 
oppose,I'm going to have to agree with Netoholic. Maybe in a few months. 
oppose,for no other reason than not here long enough. 
oppose,No edit summaries 
oppose,Oppose. I'm glad he's started using edit summaries but I'm not so sure 3 months is quite enough for a full understanding of Wikipedia's machinations. I'm perfectly willing to support next time. 
support,He is reformed and should be given a chance. 
oppose,115 edits one month a history (based on talk page) of vandalism and ya know you don't have to be an admin to write new articles. 
oppose,way too early especially after having introduced himself with acts of vandalism 
oppose,I cannot in good faith support someone with hardly any edits and who writes uppercase. [[User_talk:Anárion|<em style="fontfamily: Code2000 'Arial Unicode MS' sansserif; fontstyle: normal">&#9398;&#8469;&#940;&#8475;&#8505;&#8500;&#628;</em]]>
oppose,Too new. 
oppose,I am quite sorry. I rarely vote for oppose but there are too many detractor's on EDGE's record. First is his snits with other users and when andy said that EDGE has introduced himself with acts of vandalism. Second and I say this to EDGE himself you do not need to be an administrator to write articles on azmatology poetic terrorism and pirate utopias. Third EDGE has underestimated what kind of experience is asked of him as an administrator. Fourth he has a very fresh view of how the community works. I doubt that he read the rules on nominating himself in much depth or he wouldn't have voted for himself much less neutrally so. I would like to say to EDGE that you may want to consider a reselfnomination after at least 1000 edits. Good luck! 
oppose,User created a lot of nonsense articles on "poetic terrorism" a few days ago moved user and talk pages to random locations and caused general mayhem. 
oppose,Too new and too much odd stuff. A month or two of good solid wikipeding may change my mind. 
oppose,A reformed vandal which EDGE admits being faces a significantly higher bar in terms of earning the trust of the community. 
oppose,Too new + not enough experience + vandalism = strongly oppose. Sorry! 
oppose,Not on your life. He is NOT a reformed vandal he refuses to discuss his edits but prefers to delete discussions from his Talk page rather than to deal with them. 
oppose,I'm going with RickK on this for my firstever admin opposition vote. In less than a month he's raised quite a bit of contention especially with a respected user like Rick. If EDGE can prove himself like DJ Clayworth suggests I too would be willing to change my vote at a future date after a lot more goodfaith edits and a lot less contention. Just not yet. That thirdparty comment about the intuition raised my eyebrows a notch or two as well. 
oppose,What they said. 
oppose,Um... I keep encountering very strange edits and comments made by this user. It is difficult to know if he is really reformed. [[User_talk:Func|(talk)]]</tt> 00:14 25 Sep 2004 (UTC) (actually the recent edits to articles have been ok). 
oppose,Strongly oppose. <nowiki></nowiki> ([[User_talk:Andrevan|talk]])
support,See no reason to oppose. Eequor's comments on the link Kate provided were right on target. 
support,Looks quite constructive I see no evidence to the contrary in fact especially contribs to reference desk and so. Very decent admin material from my quick look through contribs. Oh yeah and [[TINC]]! ;) 
support,! 
support,Obviously not going to succeed this time. Opposers below appear confused. They should read more Karl Popper 
support,Eequor makes useful contributions to articles and has responded clearly and politely to the concerns raised by objectors here. 
support,Eequor may be insane but does that nessecarily mean Eequor is insane? Anyhow support on the basis that while Eequor has done some somewhat questionable things they've mostly just been too hyped up. For example what Raul said about what Eequor said about rules is a typical thing one might expect to hear from a stodgy sysop who has spent too much time enforcing rules but really what Eequor said is in complete agreement with Wikipedia policy and it should be recognised that we are meant to obey the SPIRIT of the rules and not to follow them to the letter thus good contributors don't get banned for repeat vandalism if they can offer up a good explanation (if they revert it themselves nobody usually pursues action against them). Good job Eequor. 
support,Eequor is a multitalented editor who usually uses her powers for good. If she is granted adminship and then abuses it I will be the first to start an RfC on her but I don't think she would do that. 
support,Thought she was one already. 
support,I see absolutely nothing this user has done that would justify the cruel words being levelled at her. 
support,She's a little quirky a little different... all the more reason to support. 
support,The "rules" are not a substitute for using your head and embracing the spirit of the place. Too many people here use the "rules" to browbeat other users instead of as a means of facilitating a great encyclopaedia. Let's have more admins who believe that fighting for a great encyclopaedia is more important than fighting for the status quo.
support,Although Eequor and I have had disagreements in the past a variety of viewpoints is useful for the wiki. this nomination. [[User:Rhymeless|
support,I see: No respect for authority. Completely opposed to everything I believe in. Sanity questionable. I'm surprised Eequor isn't admin already. 
oppose,<http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=MediaWiki_1.3_comments_and_bug_reports/Archive&diff=55137&oldid=55136> 
oppose,Not a chance. 
oppose,No. 
oppose,Not a constructive user. 
oppose,This just about says it all about Eequor "Clearly strict adherence to the "rules" is a naïve and insular position" <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Eequor&diff=6174589&oldid=6174566> 
oppose,Amen to most above opinions. [[User_talk:Ingoolemo|&rarr;]]
oppose,What target did Eequor hit exactly? Let's see she makes out that in a massive project like Wikipedia the fact that the cabal can't be everywhere at once is proof that there is a cabal. You just have to love the rhetorical skills that allow someone to prove the existence of a thing by its absence. I'm sure that kind of logic would greatly simplify the longrunning dispute over [[Atheism]]. 
oppose,I cannot see a possible justification for that comment for someone that would be fitting for the role of an administrator. 
oppose,While I believe I've shared some of her view points in the past Eequor took a possible hoax about a Bulgarian radiant leak from the reference desk and put it as front page news today. Not responsible. 
oppose,I'd really like to support because I think complaints about her fixation with the "cabal" are silly but editing "In the News" to repeat an user's heretofore baseless claims is reckless. 
oppose,I normally dont interfere on this things but <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Elagabalus&diff=3858403&oldid=3857436 this edit on Elagabalus>(note the recategorization) makes me wonder about Leah Q's sanity (with all due respect) and her use as a sysop. 
oppose,A lot of fine pharmacological work but also a lot of bias against traditionalist religion (a POV forcefully stated on her userpage). 
oppose,No 
oppose,I'm surprised no one has cited [[Wikipedia:Don't disrupt Wikipedia to illustrate a point]] a proposed policy with which I agree very much. Such inanity as listing rambot articles on VFD is counterproductive and not the way one should start discussion on the matter. 
support,Sorry Falcon but you have not made that many edits. I will support you after you make 600 edits. But you are doing great and keep up the good work! [[User talk:Lst27|27]] 17:33 2 Jul 2004 (UTC) I think we should give him a chance. 480 edits is good enough considering the quality of his edits. 
oppose,Will support after 750+ edits. Sorry. In the meantime take Chris 73's suggestion or if something needs to be deleted right away put <nowiki>{{delete}}</nowiki> at the top of the page. 
oppose,I agree with Merovinginan; Falcon has simply not been a contributor long enough for me to support a selfnomination. As the section heading states selfnominators should exceed the normal nomination standards by a goodly amount. Also I am concerned by a claim on this user's talk page that he is not "at all tolerant of procorporate POVs or even a hint thereof." I would find it unsettling to have a sysop who claims to have such an extreme bias. 
oppose,Oppose Falcon I'd personally suggest you set out how you would go about restructuring these pages in your user page somewhere or in a suitable article's talk page. Then hopefully a current admin can perform the changes for you (if they think they can be done without going to VfD). Later when you've more experience like the others are discussing you can (be nominated|nominate yourself) for adminship. We'd be setting a dangerous precedent otherwise. 
oppose,Not yet enough experience here. Keep working and keep participating Try again this autumn. Also if you need help deleting articles just tell me what you need done. 
oppose,Not long enough IMO. But I think the above has established that if you have administrative stuff needing to be done there are people who will help

support,I feel a kinship with Fvw. We patrol together.

support,From my somewhat limited experience wtih Fvw on the RC patrol front he seems great. Just lay off on the VfDs a bit though... 
support,Does good work. 
support,As a regular VfD reader I agree with Fvw's assessment below. Fvw does list a lot of articles and although there have been a few that were borderline most were clearly worth listing and you have to look at it as a percentage. 
support,It might be good for Fvw to be more cautious about vfd but this isn't a big deal imo. So long as he wouldn't speedily delete articles outside of policy it doesn't bother me. And he certainly doesn't seem too new to me. Are these the only objections? > ([[User_talk:Quadell|talk]]) (
oppose,Regular contributor only since October 13 (prior to that a total of about 50 scattered edits). 
oppose,Too new. Nothing personal. 
oppose,Much too new too many ledgit articles put up on VfD that turned out to be keepers. Five minutes of forethought saves hours of peoples' time on VfD. 
oppose,Oppose. Not an editor I'd be comfortable with allowing to speedily delete articles. I disagree with Shane I'm afraid. I think you should only list articles you are sure should be deleted. Yes Fvw listed some obvious vanities etc but it's my belief that deletion policy is aimed at not hanging the innocent rather than rewarding those who execute a few of the guilty. I'm particularly alarmed by Fvw's listing "Kirkegaard Associates" as a candidate for speedy deletion while it was still under discussion on VfD. 
oppose,Oppose! this IGNORANT FOOL wanted to delete the [[Lil Jon]] article. because Lil Jon MULTIPLATINUM CRUNK LEGEND is somehow "not notable." what the fuck? this playahater should be BANNED not promoted. 
oppose,With respect to the Lil Jon VfD either fvw didn't bother to check the edit history/old versions or didn't bother to check about notability both of which should be standard prior to listing on VfD. Everyone makes mistakes but combined with the other objections raised I must oppose.

support,giving wide leeway to administrator discretion which I believe Guanaco has still fallen within the realm of. 
support,But try to use a bit more care in making decisions. 
support,Of course. I am refraining from commenting on what I think of this vote. 
support,I tend to disagree with most of Guanaco's positions but I am also dismayed that this vote is even taking place. 
support,He's not a bad guy. We're all human humans make mistakes even if he really is bit of a rouge admin I won't name names but there are far worse out there. 
support,Try to lay low and use some restraint for a while. 
oppose,Has repeatedly done dubious things in regard to admin powers and has often been recalcitrant when asked about them. He may have once been a fine admin but in the last few months he's become a rogue admin. 
oppose,Not enough activity lately (18 edits in all of November). 
oppose,I regret having to agree with everything Ambi says. Furthermore I believe that admins who are willing to take unilateral actionsactions which may or may not be in accord with the will of the communityshould be ready to explain themselves and discuss their reasonings when the inevitable questions arise. If their actions are repeatedly challenged they should stop. Guanaco did not to my knowledge show himself to be open to discussion of his controversial actions nor did he stop after several challenges from other users. This kind of rash unilateralism in the use of sysop abilities is unsuitable to say the least. 
oppose,Criticism of Guanaco has hardly been limited to "the Cantus matter." He frequently abused his privileges and acted with disdain toward community consensus. He makes no effort to "play well with others" and the ArbCom decision should be considered carefully. The mistake of his original election should not be repeated. 
oppose,Ambi's assessment of the situation is quite true I find. I can't support a history of conflict like that. 
oppose,No. Admins should act with consensus and be held to a higher standard. We value all editors but I don't believe this one should have sysop powers. 
oppose,I now oppose after Guanaco's inexplicable unblocking of HistoryBuffEr. 
oppose,I have to oppose to this nomination.
oppose,Oppose. 
oppose,Weak oppose. I don't get his need to unprotect user pages which leads me to not trust him. There are better things to be doing as an admin. I think it might be a good idea to have all admins reapply after a certain period but I don't like that Guanaco is the only one having to do so. I don't feel like reading all the ArbCom matter but if they felt he needs to reapply they might as well just deadmin and let it be that. 
oppose,Sorry Guanaco. I think you're generally a good guy. But your unprotecting of user pages gets on my nerves. And your unblocking of Historybuffer's IPs was outofline in my opinion. I agree with Cribcage that you shouldn't be using your admin powers during this vote. Also your banter with Neutrality and Cribcage above is I don't know unsavory. 
oppose,Oppose agree with Ambi.[[User:Bishonen|
oppose,I cannot in good faith support for continued adminship someone who believes that blocked users should feel free to evade their blocks by anonymous editing and who even goes so far as to hinder other administrators attempting to enforce the block. 
oppose,Cannot support unilateral actions and do not believe admins should have "leeway": that's a licence for roguery.
oppose,Not the worst admin we have but that said we need to deadmin people who don't show wisdom in the use of their powers. It may not happen in order of merit but it has to start somewhere. Here's to precident. 
oppose,Guanaco seems to be a blazing loose cannon. 
oppose,Oppose reluctantly since I am not an admin and don't feel it's necessarily appropriate for me to vote against an admin but I really feel strongly that admin powers any and all of them should be reserved for folks who are to a great extent beyond reproach and who take pains to accurately assess and follow consensus. I wouldn't oppose renomination if it seems suitable at a later date. 
oppose,Oppose 
oppose,Oppose. 
oppose,Oppose community confidence not there. 
oppose,Christmas comes early this year. 
oppose,Very Strongly Oppose. A puppet of troll/vandal user Lir. 
oppose,Request disciplinary action against nominator. 
oppose,Nominee has shown refusal to answer basic questions about understanding of administrative responsibilities regrets not edit warring more and his best contribution is not actually an article in the encyclopedia he is seeking administrator status for. Furthermore I am unsure how he could have been an admin a year ago when he didn't even post here a year ago. This nomination is as much of a joke as Fifth World nations and parallel Internets. 
oppose,Tricky given that the account was created in May. Doesn't even have 50 edits and most of those are troublesome. 
oppose,Hmm. Let's see. "Authentic fifth world expert" (e.g. person who creates articles that should be on speedy delete). Likely is sockpuppet. Has fewer than 50 edits. Of course I enthusiastically support! </sarcasm> Oppose.

oppose,Ban them all. 
oppose,Strongly oppose for reasons mentioned above. 
oppose,Don't do this Lir. 
support,Don't see the harm. 
support,Deletionism is not a reason to oppose adminship and this contributor has shown no other reason to do so. 
oppose,1/3 (226/734) of his edits are VfDrelated. Rest are fairly minor long runs of category (Sep 6) and redirect bypassing (Nov 5). Politics around deletionism (or inclusionism) is probably overblown on RFA but <http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Association_of_Deletionist_Wikipedians&diff=74027&oldid=73997 participants> in <http://meta.wikimedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Association_of_Deletionist_Wikipedians&diff=72903&oldid=72879 ADW> are a different matter. Contributions he's made adding content to Wikipedia are overshadowed by this. I also note a lack of [[Wikipedia:Edit summary|edit summary]] use. Maybe in a couple of months. 
oppose,Too few edits. Should have more than 2000. 
oppose,New page patrol is great but he has a very broad definition of a speedy delete (see [[Sundissential|1]] [[Hugh Lawrie|2]] [[Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Homestyle|3]] [[Wikipedia:Votes for deletion/Mote Prime|4]] [[Nick Valensi|5]] [[Caddo Parish Middle Magnet School|6]] [[Sun King|7]]this one got to me because it was obviously a newbie's atempt at a redirect ect). Failed attempts to speedy appear to consitute a shocking portion of his nonVfD edits. Granted much of this stuff is garbage but they don't fit speedy criteria. He hasn't done it in the last week and a half but I would much prefer to have other admins review his deletion judgement for the time being. Aside from that he has great contributions and I'd almost undoubtably support him next time around. 
oppose,Lack of edit summaries makes it almost impossible for me to assess his contributions. Not tagging your edits shows a basic lack of courtesy to other editors. Start making an effort to tag edits please and maybe I can support. I'm neutral on the deletionism charges: politics shouldn't play a part in adminship. The number of incorrect speedys is impossible to pass judgement on without knowing the number of correct speedies: it may be a very low error rate for all we know. 
oppose,Agree with the above: Some of the speedys show poor judgment and no edit summaries. Furthermore too few edits. I'd prefer to see more value added rather than just deletion of articles.
oppose,Agree with the above. Please try again in three months. 
support,Itai has made over 2200 edits since the start of December and seems to have a good understanding of Wikipedia. 
support,A brief glance through the user's history shows nothing but good edits. 
support,on the condition that he harms no carrots. 
oppose,Oppose for now on the grounds given above and I'd also like to know what the "illumination" that Itai feels this is a step towards is.> 
oppose,Oppose until user clarifies cryptic message. 
support,Nicely edited a lot of esoterica and is dedicated. 
support,Thought he already was one. 
support,Great contributions and in my experience a very personable person. Also I'm not sure if it was intentional but Jor's having the bizarre 'Inserted by a true Eldar' comment at the top of their talk page never ceases to amuse me. 
support,Speaking from my experience with Jor he is an excellent editor and a reasonable person. I've not been involved in the apparently controversial Polish/German issue but I am confident based on what I've seen that he would do well. 
support,Excellent contributer. Go Jor! 
support,I've dealt with Jor/darkelf on several subjects and found him (?) to be reasonable levelheaded and conscientious. I for one have been around this particular block enough not to fall for the tired old "he's a nazi/he's a zionist/he's a commie/he's a homo/he's lefthanded" line. In such namecalling the seeds of tyranny lie. 
support,He has allot of contributions and responded promptly to an inquiry. 
support,Has done 5 times in 5 months what I have done in 6. Clearly a dedicated contributor. 
support,Well everything I've seen from him is just fine. While I see some users I respect voting against him the sockpuppetry and such going on below suggests that if I'm to judge him by his enemies he's probably a good apple. 
support,I looked into this and could only find good edits. I think his detractors make a poor case but if they can improve it perhaps I'd change my vote. As is the reverts I see him having made don't involve revert wars but rather correcting poor edits. 
support,a bit tentatively. I don't know much about Jor but we had a conflict some months ago and it was resolved amicably due to what I felt was good faith on his part which is more than I can say for many current admins. Many of the reasons for oppose below (such as Ruhrjung's and Moncrief's) are not compelling. In the German/Polish battle he did seem to me aggressive at times but I can understand the frustration of dealing with e.g. Wik etc. and what I've seen indicates he is more reasonable than to abuse admin status to win edit wars. And if he does I'm sure he'll get the full treatment (a la ) from the vocal critics below. 
oppose,Strongly oppose. Rude Germanreactionary POV pusher who asked me "Does this appease your Polish nationalism?" when I tried to call Szczecin by its current name. And later regarding &#346;winouj&#347;cie: "I merely shifted them because known vandal User:Wik insists on adding 'former'" and "Screw this I've better things to do than try and fix Wik's vandalism." See <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Swinoujscie&dummy=1&diff=2392366&oldid=2392307 here> how Jor changes the correct names &#346;winouj&#347;cie and Szczecin referring to the present Polish cities to the old German names Swinemünde and Stettin! 
oppose,Cautiosly oppose. A person who takes as his own task to "remove from count" votes against himself<http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship&diff=2966676&oldid=2966674> does not seem to have sufficient trust in other wikipedians seems too eager to protect his own prestige and too eager to become administrator.
oppose,02:36 30 Mar 2004 (UTC) lots of GermanCentral European POV pushing. And I'll note that while I myself have been involved in disputes over Central European article naming issues I've spent a lot more time fighting against the sock puppet types who've been hurling abuse at Jor than I have against Jor (or Nico). But I'd vote against any of them being made admins. 
oppose,I remember Jor being involved in edit wars having problems with NPOV calling opponents "problem users" and "vandals" and so on. He should show that he can do better before being granted adminship. 
oppose,Oppose. Edit wars rude bahaviour. Far away from NPOV. 
oppose,Oppose we don't need combatants in PolishGerman wars as admins. 
oppose,Oppose. is right on. 
oppose,Oppose. I have to admit that some of my trepidation is due to the fact that he is taking such an active role in the voting process for him here. Yikes. (Someone will no doubt point out that there's no rule against doing so. Fine it's just a personal preference then that those being voted on should back off from constant edits and justifications on the tally). 
oppose,Oppose. However if more time passes and Jor seems to be getting along with the other kids on the block and staying out of POV trouble then I think he'd make a great sysop. 
oppose,Oppose. POVPusher. 
oppose,Better safe than sorrywe shouldn't hand out guns to combatants on either side of any major POV conflict. 
support,<http://kohl.wikimedia.org/~kate/cgibin/count_edits?user=Leonard+G.&dbname=enwiki Over 10k edits> although curiously few in Wikipedia or User namespace. Having read the talk page Leonard G. seems like a good candidate.

support,These opposes are absolutely ridiculous. 
support,After 10000 edits what namespace you edit in is totally irrelevant.This should be no big deal remember? A good candidate for a good cause ;). 
support,I see absolutely no reason for punishing an editor for not involving himself in policymaking or the swirling stinking BS that passes for it nor for avoiding the petty politics and borderline warfare that some Wikipedia namespace articles host. It would probably be much more beneficial for Wikipedia if we discouraged it given that we already have more than enough policy to go round when [[Wikipedia:Five pillars|this]] would actually suffice. 
support,due to his high volume of quality articles [[bridge]] in particular. Pleasant to work with. 
support,due to the quality of his contributions.
oppose,Its nothing against Leonard G. I looked at his contributions and I've decided to oppose. 
oppose,and quite strongly too. Article stuff is good I'll say that up front. But the contributions to the admin related areas are really very small. Only 93 Wikipedia: edits is just too few for me. Also the answers to the neutral votes below do appear to reveal some lack of clarity on what adminship brings in terms of additional abilities and responsibilities. His response to Angr is seriously misjudged and Angr's reasoning was perfectly civil. I don't fully understand the response to Scimitar at all; it appears to be a railing against the whole structure of Wikipedia along with some things he'd like to see changed. Unless I misunderstand Scimitar hadn't asked for a wishlist of technical features. This seems to me to be another misjudgement of a comment. The response to Encephalon includes alarming responses regarding what amounts to a "hardly every delete" with little or no reference to policy. It is not for admins to decide they don't like a policy and thence to sidestep it. I'd suggest spending some time in the areas you'd plan to help out in with your admin duties (you don't say where that would be very clearly) and see what kind of discussions take place there. Once you've got something like several hundred Wikipedia: or Wikipedia talk: edits you'll be far more sure of how to judge this kind and other kinds of discussion. As an added bonus you'll have a clearer picture of whether you'd be happy doing admin things. Meantime keep up the excellent article work. 
oppose,as per Splash.
oppose,as per and . Leonard G.'s answers here demonstrate a poor understanding of administrative functions as well as WP policies. I am also concerned with the escalating tone of his replies the last few of which sound outright hostile. Mind you Leonard G. has every right to be angry at the comments he reads here; he has spent countless hours doing valuable work for Wikipedia and in return he gets criticism about what may seem like a superficial issue of form and manners. However as an admin he will face criticism like this on a daily basis and must be prepared to deal with it in an eventempered consensusbuilding manner. 
oppose,as above. Too few WP space edits for me to support at this time. 
support,I don't think the talk page should have been blanked but since it was offtopic it wasn't wildly inappropriate or anything. 
support,Having browsed LGagnon's edits particularly appearances on talk pages I cautiously support this candidacy. I'm eager to give him access to the roll back feature but not quite convinced with regard to his maturity. A pity that the opposition below seems pretty numerous. (Yes I disagree with the opponents.) /
support,I'm supporting for a number of reasons: a) It appears to be an isolated incident (one contentious edit in a history of 5000 is still very good) b) it's probably within the letter of the law and c) I think that this conversation is enough to make him aware that following convention is sometimes as important as what is explicitly written in the rules. Other than this one minor issue what is left is a very good contributor. 
support,was correct to attempt to refocus the discussion on [[talk:Stephen King]]. 
support,Deleting the discussion may be a little improper but certain users are blowing it way out of proportion.

oppose,He didn't blank any pages but he removed discussion. Bad idea. 
oppose,Strongly oppose. Two reasons. 1. I plan to use my admin status to block users is not promising. I wouldn't vote for anyone who saw this as the primary goal of adminship. 2. I firmly believe consensus is built on talk not reversion and forcing your POV. I am not so much worried by his blanking the talk page as his general attitude that he will decide for himself when people need "censoring". Contrition and a repeated commitment to consensus would have been far more persuasive than being adamant that censorship is a valuable tool for an editor. I've changed my vote to reflect the further discussion with LGagnon.
oppose,Opposeas I understand it convention is that we leave talk pages alone unless they are our user talk pages; obviously in this case the talk page in question was not LGagnon's user talk page.

support,I don't entirely know how the admin's diet of death threats slanderous "cabal" bleating and miscellaneous underinformed moaning from the project's ginsoaked mailinglist geriatics is going to improve Lucky's satisfactionquotient but my concern for Lucky's happinesswellbeing isn't a material reason for Lucky to not be an admin. Lucky is an even tempered productive forebearant and dilligent wikipedian in whose calloused hands the keys to the wikipedia mop&bucket cupboard can safely be placed. 
support,Just STAY AROUND long enough to use these powers!!! 
support,I'm glad you couldn't stay away Lucky. 
support,I cannot express the strength of my support enough. In the "Bmovie bandit" episode Lucky was tireless at cleaning up the mess left in his wake. If you look at Lucky's contributions you will not find them in meta or in tables and borders. Those things are important but Lucky's contributions are in the articles giving Wikipedia content endlessly rescuing orphaned items from the Clean Up list thinking carefully about how he can improve our site. I have never seen Lucky fail in his principles his energy or his desire to make us a better project. 
support,I was gonna nominate him if he came back but Raul beat me to it. I support fullheartedly. 
support,[[User Talk:Texture|&#964;]]
support,Lucky has proven himself to be a responsible user if somewhat uh rash. However I believe in demystifying the position of sysop and I think Lucky can handle this position well enough. 
support,I have every confidence thwt Lucky 6.9 as demonstrated on his numerous VfD contributions will not abuse admin powers. 
support,Huh??? I thought Lucky 6.9 was already an administrator. Strongly support. 
support,He has helped me multiple times. . 
support,Always been impressed with the gruntwork he does. 
support,I trust Lucky's judgment let's give him reasons to stay. Burnout can be prevented by community support rather than denying him the sysops right clearly due to him. 
support,Ralph is a good guy and will make a good editor. 
support,I was going to abstain. I know Lucky can be a little hot headed. I know I can be. For some poeple extra responsibility/power leads to the dark side. For others it has a sobering effect: the knowledge that it can be taken away the shame that can bring. I think Lucky is one who will be sobered by the trust we place in him. 
oppose,His work is good but we need a commitment to stay with Wikipedia and not to quit every time the going gets tough. 
oppose,Good editor but I don't like statements like this on the Childlove VfD page: "Let's get off the POV/NPOV bandwagon and just speedy delete this. No redirect no nothing except for maybe reporting this pervert to the proper authorities. If this stays I go for good and I hope that others will consider doing likewise as well." He needs to be less hotheaded and stay on the NPOV bandwagon especially as a sysop when he has the power to actually speedydelete pages he finds offensive. 
oppose,With all due respect to 's vote I think it's ridiculous to describe this user as "eventempered." 
oppose,It's nice to see that he keeps coming back and I have no complaints to make about his work. However he's just barely returned from his latest departure and under such circumstances I can't endorse him for admin right away when he keeps leaving out of frustration. Needs more time not to learn the ropes in this case but to show he can hang on to them. 
oppose,Having never dealt with Lucky personally I can only attest to my superficial impression of him as a loose cannon. I'm apparently not alone in my concern over granting this person deletion powers. 
oppose,Given past experience with user on VFD and noting the nominator I fear that he may may also consider niceties like <nowiki>{{subst:test}}</nowiki> and other warnings as "too mealymouthed". 
oppose,I'm afraid I must oppose. Lucky is a great contributor but is not suited for adminshipI've warned him multiple times about zealotry in using the speedy deletion template as have other users. Some users are simply more valuable contributors without adminship. No mark against him personally but strong opposition. [[User:Meelar|
oppose,Good user but not ready yet IMHO perhaps in another couple of months. 
oppose,Opposed for reasons 1 2 and 9 above. 
oppose,Lucky is a great guy but he seems to take disagreements personally too often. I'm willing to reconsider sometime in the future. 
oppose,Oppose for reasons 1 and 2 above. 
oppose,Oppose. Lucky appears to be a student of Rick's bull in a china shop approach to adminship. I'd rather not WP went further down this road. 
oppose,Oppose. Way too eager to delete things and not discuss things out. 
oppose,After an outburst like: "Unilateral censorship?!? Fuck this whole thing once and for all. Keep your precious article. Damn you. Sysops please delete my pages just as soon as I'm through blanking them. 06:33 3 Aug 2004 (UTC)" (retrieved from [[Wikipedia:Votes_for_deletion/Childlove_movement]]) inviting this editor to admin amounts to nothing more than [[appeasement]]. 
oppose,Regretfully I think Lucky is a little too hasty at times and would decide by emotion rather than judgement. 
oppose,I'm not too concerned with oppose #1 per se; the stated reasons may be questionable but the net effect is similar to counting to ten to cool down before you continue a conversation which can be a good thing. A minor related issue is it seemed to me like at least one departure was somewhat overly dramatic; I'm more concerned about his willingness to try to sway VfD voting by threatening to leave but that isn't enuf to get me to oppose since it's not related to admin duties. I'm a bit more concerned about #2 and while in his answers he indicates a desire to abide by the group's consenus I have concerns about whether he would be able to do so in one of his more um Wikistressed moments. I don't disagree with #12 but in the long run/big picture I think that will have more negative effects on Lucky's joy of life/state of bliss/whatever than on Wikipedia. But my biggest concern and the reason I've been hoping this vote wouldn't happen is #8 as I am one of the "other users" that expressed similar concerns on Lucky's talk page. Thus I again have concerns about good intentions losing out to exasperation. For example I don't believe this<http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Machi&diff=5135876&oldid=5135523> is a speedy candidateit says what (who) the article is about what they are notable for and where they are noted for itand I have to assume that Mattingly23 must have come to a similar conclusion. More recently when to my knowledge he wasn't in Wikistress mode he speedy tagged this eight sentence article<http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Teoti&diff=5175375&oldid=5175189> (which I thot more of a VfD candidate and later Guanaco found it to be a copyvio but I think that speaks to its coherence). I should point out that like Meelar I think Lucky is a very admirable and valuable contributor and I'll add that since I became an admin and started hanging around the speedy cat I think I see more {delete} tags from him than anyone except maybe Grunt (but I also know that timezones heavily affect who sees whose activity) and the strong majority are clearly deletable so whatever the outcome of the vote I hope he continues to find them however he does it. (FWIW this is the first time I've felt strongly enuf about a nomination to cast a vote.) 
oppose,I usually don't oppose nominations but I am seriously concerned abouth Lucky's lack of regard for both [[Wikipedia:Etiquette|Wikiquette]] and [[Wikipedia:WikiLove|Wikilove]]. These are qualities that are essential to be a leader/[[sysop]] in a tolerant community. Perhaps if he changes his behavior I can support in the future. 
oppose,Oppose as per above comments. 
oppose,Changing vote from neutral; this user's new "bmovie bandit" template is just too much for me. 
support,As above. 
support,Yes a thousand times yes. (feel free to count that as 1001 distinct votes.) [[User:Rhymeless|
support,Strongly support. Reasons should be obvious. 
support,Good longtime editor. My concerns have been addressed. This is long overdue really. 
support,Mhmm. 
support,Lucky is a good trustworthy contibutor. I support. 
support,I'll echo Rhymeless' vote. ;) Definite support. 
support,ed last time still support this time! 
support,Gzornenplatz should learn that merits should be taken into account and not politics based on whether or not you think we should all have peace and love and accept the ugliest of substubs. 
support,ABSOLUTELY. That is all. 
support,Absolutely: Lucky works harder than about anyone here and he has shown consistent dedication. He has demonstrated a concern for the quality and health of the project. 
support,Strongly support. He's one of the most dedicated patrollers you'll find around here (even if the stress does get to him sometimes). 
support,No problem supporting much better candidate than most other users we get on here and RC Patrol can be a very wikistressraising place. 
support,Lucky on balance is a real asset to the Wikipedia community. I have faith in his putting on his best face to new Wikipedians and he has been a pleasure to work with in creating new articles. I believe Lucky has shown greater maturity over time not less. He has stuck around and not left for good. Lucky can be trusted with the keys to the "janitor's closet." He has the best interests of Wikipedia at heart. 
support,appears to be a very dedicated member of the community 
support,support for keeping the crap out of wikipedia. 
support,Our man in the [[Coachella Valley]]. 
support,YES! YES! YES! YES! YES! 
support,We're Lucky to have him. Warm no hot support. Recommend burnout prevention but this is no impediment to adminship. 
support,[[User:Frazzydee|
oppose,Always highstrung and gets burned out far too easily. Same person who about a month ago requested his user pages be deleted because he was leaving and then returned a week later. I think we need admins who are more stable and reliable. Maybe next time. 
oppose,I'm still concerned about edits like <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Slagelse&diff=6738103&oldid=6704463 this>. He has to learn to leave valid stubs alone. 
oppose,Reluctantly oppose. Lucky has made major contributions to the Wikipedia both contentwise and as a member of the RC patrol. I respect him for this. The vast majority of his interactions with other users have been extremely constructive and positive with Lucky using tact and patience to get his point across. And his points are generally good ones; Lucky always has the best interests of the Wikipedia at heart.However as an RC patroller I have seen the occasional angry abusive message left on anonymous users' talk pages. For example: <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:24.29.6.115&diff=0> and <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:67.113.84.98>. There are others. I don't care how bad a vandal these users are there is never any excuse for such abusive [[Wikipedia:No personal attacks|personal attacks]]. I understand that Lucky may get frustrated at vandals from time to time. (Who doesn't?) Getting frustrated is one thing. Exploding over it is quite another.One of my personal standards for administrators is that candidates must never violate the [[Wikipedia:Civility|civility policy]]. Admins must represent the most hardworking trustworthy and friendly face of Wikipedia. Lucky fits the profile well except for these periodic outbursts of anger. Incivility is not to be tolerated under any circumstances and certainly not from our admins. Therefore I cannot in good faith support Lucky for adminship. Sorry. 
oppose,He should have been an admin long ago. I have changed my vote to oppose. Recent edits that contain extreme personal attacks such as "Yo fucktard.<...>Get a life buttbleed" that were brought to my attention above have tainted my otherwise high opinion of Lucky. Being highstrung is ok but insulting users even worthless vandals is unacceptable especially by admins (or prospective admins). I cannot support Lucky as much as I feel he is an otherwise good user. 
oppose,After reading posts on IP address user talk pages (where it is unlikely the vandal will even see it) that contain profanity and uncivilized conduct I have to seriously consider the user's value as a contributor. Blatantly breaking Wikipolicy once can negate 510 strong contributions to the community in my POV. Since the posts in question were as recent as 2 days ago by this logic I find it possible for the user to actually be in the negative numbers. I cannot support this in a user much less an admin. I; therefore strongly oppose. 
oppose,I would love to be able to vote for Lucky. He is an excellent contributor a tireless workhorse of Wikipedia doing many thankless tasks. If this was a vote concerning whether or not Lucky deserved thanks and honor for this work I'd support hands down. Sadly though Lucky's temper especially with newbies is seemingly incompatible with the role and responsibilities of an admin. I am very open to the possibility that Lucky will find better ways of communicating displeasure and gentler methods of working with new users I opposed Mike H way back when out of a concern for the way he handled disputes and I'm now pleased to say I think he's very good at it and I was happy to support him when he was renominated. I fervently hope that Lucky takes a similar path. Until Lucky consistently respects [[Wikipedia:Wikiquette]] and [[Wikipedia:Wikilove]] though I'm afraid I will continue to oppose and simply thank him sincerely for the many hours of work he does here. 
oppose,When I noticed Lucky 6.9's nomination here I was very excited and couldn't wait to add my name to the list of supporters I have long admired his tireless work right there on the front line of quality control on the pedia. However it is with extreme reluctance that I have to agree that the recent highly abusive comments left on anons' talk pages make him an unsuitable candidate at this time. Lucky I see the undertakings you've given here that you will work to curb this behaviour and I believe that you will honour those promises. If you don't make sysop this time I'll be looking forward to supporting your nomination next time when you'll be able to point out that such behaviour is well and truly in the past. 
oppose,too quick to tag things for speed delete volatile in interactions w/ other editors. That said Lucky has made a lot of worthwhile contributions. 
oppose,Seems as if Lucky likes to put speedy tags on articles which may be notable or those which are precedented as VfD material. His overzealousness alone makes me cautious but coupled with very recent insults on talk pages "Yo fucktard. Take your cute little fluffy doggie and stick him where the sun don't shine. Get a life buttbleed." just drives the nail in the coffin. 
oppose,I hate opposing nominations here. But i agree 100% with Jwrosenzweig. 
oppose,I also agree with . I'd like to see more [[Wikipedia:Wikiquette|wikiquette]] less questionable speedy deletetags and less temper first. 
oppose,Oppose on the basis of the valid objections noted by other users.
oppose,I too concur with Jwrosenzweig. [[Wikipedia:Wikiquette|Wikiquette]] and [[Wikipedia:Wikilove|Wikilove]] are essential perhaps the most important qualities of an admin. I would be willing to support if Lucky became more mindfull of his behavior toward other users no matter how frustrating.
oppose,Darn. I like the guy but his temper gets in the way especially after seeing the abovementioned <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:24.29.6.115&diff=0> and <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:67.113.84.98>. 
oppose,Oppose. Lucky69 could not resolve his conflicts and then up and quit a few months ago. From what I remember and <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Childlove_movement/Deletion_debate_archive read here> his posts were very POV to the point where he wanted to do away with discussion and just speedy delete articles he did not like. I fear he will do as he suggested and delete things without going though the proper process. 
oppose,Oppose. I have not seen any marked change in his behaviour since the last time he was up for adminship. Too much of a loose cannon bellicose. 
oppose,Oppose with regret. Good user with a short temper as by the comments above. 
oppose,He or she has a short temper... Dont be mistaken I have NEVER voted to oppose someone. But sorry.. 
oppose,I have changed my vote to with regret. An admin cannot afford to have a short fuse. 
oppose,Oppose reluctantly for now. 
support,Strongly. 
support,Mmhm. 
support,I like what I've seen. 
support,Trollhunter! Vandalslayer! Take thy rightful place among and ! #
support,About time. This guy has spent so much time fighting vandals (and writing featured articles) he certainly deserves it. Furthermore I believe the issues that caused some to oppose before are indeed solved now. 
support,This is long overdue; however I will echo my concerns from the last RfA I want to stress to Lucky how important it is that he strictly abide by [[Wikipedia:Deletion policy]] and [[Wikipedia:Candidates for speedy deletion]]. 
support,Excellent user. Short temper and I opposed last time due to a particularly bad comment to a vandal (something like "put your fucking doggie where the sun don't shine" but I don't remember specifically) but he has expressed regret for the comment and that's enough for me. 
oppose,Why do people have to force these things? How many failed nominations does it take to get a clue here? Lucky has unfortunately not changed his behaviour and continues to redirect valid stubs to other topics that don't have the information or to mark them for speedy deletion (which I'm quite sure he would not even bother with as a sysop he would just delete them). 
oppose,Still [[Wikipedia:Please do not bite the newcomers|bites newcomers]]. Last RfA was held less than one month ago and I'd not fault Lucky if he graciously withdrew this current RfA and let some time pass. 
oppose,Oppose for the same reasons I did three weeks ago. Please give some time between rerenominations; three weeks is certainly not sufficient. 
oppose,Not near enough experience. 
oppose,Needs more experience (Maybe DarkHorizon overstates it by saying 'Not near enough' however) 
oppose,Sorry but even with the "Adminship shouldn't be a big deal" policy (nothing against him personally) this user is far below requirements (500 edits barely more than a month as a registered user). 
oppose,Not enough time here especially when the number of contributions is not particularly high. I would give the nomination far more consideration (that is take the time to evaluate the quality of contributions) if it came from a more disinterested party. 
oppose,Good work as an editor but has no activity at all in the Wikipedia: namespace and no interaction on Talk: pages so no way of telling whether he would be a good admin or not. 
oppose,I'm about of an age with Marine (call me Army 6769) and I'd be flattered if one of my daughters nominated me so nicely but this is way too soon in terms of time edits and variety. Hope he'll be back in a couple of months when we know him better. 
oppose,I'm very sorry but I must agree (not enough edits) although Marine is a good decent user. 
oppose,He seems like a nice person but just not enough experience to qualify. 
oppose,Good user. Try again in a few months. 
oppose,Minimal experience in time (3 months min is my guideline to see user interaction etc) and in edits (only 3 digits). Worries me also that nominator appears to be a family member. Maybe someday but not yet. 
support,(I'm assuming the nominator supports. 
support,I voted no last time but Tony has done so much editing since then including a very high proportion of new articles so this time I support. 
support,Good User[[User:Plato|
support,05:48 1 Nov 2004 (UTC) I'm changing my vote to support for similar reasons to Davidcannon's vote. 
support,I can't support someone who rarely tags their edits as this practice makes it very difficult for people reading the history of the page. 00:18 Oct 27 2004 (UTC) I see he's responded to my comments and has been tagging his edits. Great work it's a good quality to be able to take criticism and work to improve. I now support! 
oppose,His acceptance of this nomination is only his 2nd edit in the Wikipedia: namespace. Admin candidates need a of work to show they understand policy and the community. 
oppose,Oppose for now. Not just the Joaquin Phoenix incident mentioned by Ambi but a similar conduct in a dispute over [[Agustín Stahl]] and [[Tomás Batista]] thereafter. I haven't observed any problems since and might reconsider at a later date but please have somebody other than Antonio nominate you next time. 
oppose,Oppose. 
oppose,Maybe in a couple of months. 
oppose,Oppose. Needs to do more of the wikichores that "nobody notices"; provide edit summaries when editing; and show up more in the 'back corridors' of the wikipedia.
support,Looks good. 
support,Beat me to it! 
oppose,Far too few edits thus far. 
oppose,Excellent contributor but he's only been here for two and a half months. Can we wait a while longer? 
oppose,I'd like to see more work too. Happy to consider again later. 
support,Strongly support Maurreen has been doing a lot of important household chores for Wikipedia and these are often thankless tasks like tightening up policy pages for example on original research; exploring ways of improving the quality of content through the enclyopedic standards and Wikipedia 1.0 initiatives; and developing consistency in the Style Manual. Whether it's a policy page or an article a text is always improved by Maurreen editing it both in terms of quality and consistency of content and in terms of the writing itself. 
support,The comment below from jguk seems to be motivated by some runins with Maurreen. I did quite a bit of looking around the pages he mentioned and I can find no Wikiquette issues. Maurreen does quite a bit of discussion chores etc. She uses logic and doesn't appear to be hostile. She's not afraid of confrontation and when faced with it I found her to be very civil. Talk pages look good contributions look good. 
oppose,Weak oppose.
oppose,Strong oppose. Unfortunately this editor does not understand Wikiquette. There are numerous instances of her not assuming good faith. Where debates are not going the way she wishes she overreacts always taking the debate further rather than stepping back and moving on (see the history of [[Talk:September 11 2001 attacks]] and [[Wikipedia talk:Manual of Style]]). She deliberately increases the heat in a discussion even arguing strongly about the omission of the word "good" in an article <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AManual_of_Style&diff=7991009&oldid=7989777>. In a discussion on the Manual of Style she even proposed deleting all the comments in favour of a proposal (which outnumbered those taking the "oppose" stance she strongly believed in) whilst implying later on in the page that since there was not any support for that proposal it should be dropped. She also promotes alternative policies: such as (in my words) "consensus is necessary for textual changes to an article"; "let's fix some 'good' articles on the version they are now on". She also places "NPOV" tags onto articles without explaining why. Taken as a whole it is clear this editor is not ready to be trusted as a sysop. 
oppose,now but might support later. Not clearly a 'bad' candidate just needs a little more polish and more work on 'admin chores'. Would support this candidate if Maurreen demonstrates a better understanding that wikipedia needs more lubrication and less friction. (bear in mind that I myself do not meet my own <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Standards standards for admins>) Maurreen is generally a good editor. 
oppose,Far too soon for adminship. Moreover those things which she has done would not be enhanced by adminship. 
oppose,Account is too young. Would prefer to see more Wikitime under their belt. 
support,Less than 500 edits but they date to October 2003 and they all look good. I know Kingturtle prefers to see 3000+ edits from admin nominees but I think promoting different personality types is helpful. There are some who can afford to spend upward of four hours every day working on Wikipedia but that's one certain type of personality and I don't think that personality type should dominate the admin staff. I'd like to see different types of people among the admin ranks and Misterrick appears an ideal candidate. 
support,Wikipedia is not Kingturtle's exclusive country club. 
oppose,Less than 300 edits. Also the nomination text seems to be copied verbatim from an earlier nomination of Alex <name removed>. 
oppose,Oppose without prejudice. Really too few edits over seven months and many of those minor or corrections of corrections. Everyone can't be on the ball all the time but it wouldn't better if a sysop could have more presence here. Happy to look again in a few months. 
oppose,Far too few edits for me to judge this users candidacy. 
oppose,Looking at his contributions Misterrick seems more interested in becoming an admin than anything else. This is the fourth time he's nominated himself <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship&oldid=1684310#Misterrick> <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship&oldid=2120208#Misterrick> <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship&oldid=2323583#Misterrick>. 
oppose,Frequentlyrepeated requests for adminship make me leery. 
oppose,Too few edits. If he has 300 now how many did he have when he first nominated himself? 
oppose,No. 
oppose,I agree with Cyrius. 
support,Haven't run into Nathanlarson32757 but the most unpleasant thing I can find in his history is [[pet skunk|some skunks]] so he has my full support. 
support,Strong Trustworthy. 
oppose,Way too early and he can't use the preview button having made some 150 edits to [[Pet skunk]] over two days. 
oppose,I will support in one month. 
oppose,Show preview is your friend. 
oppose,I'd prefer admins having a little more Wikitime under their belt. I will support in three months. 
oppose,Good editor but still very new. User wants to help in vfd but I didn't notice any vfd votes (glanced at the last 1000 edits). Would support after a bit more experience. 
oppose,Consider having a sysop nominate you in a couple of months. 
oppose,Again I agree with Michael Ward. Sorry a bit too soon for my support. 
oppose,I apologize but you haven't been a user long enough for me to support. Get more experience first. 
oppose,Sorry too little experience. Also hasn't done much janitorial work yet. [[User:MacGyverMagic|
oppose,Has shown self to be a good editor but hasn't yet really done policyrelated work yet. 
oppose,Not yet ready for prime time. 
oppose,Needs more time in the fleshy underbelly of Wikipedia. 
oppose,Oppose. I'd like to see more backstage activity and a wider edit base. Not a bad editor at all but I prefer to see editors be active in doing 'chores' before becoming an admin. 
oppose,2 main reasons: a) "Needs more time in the fleshy underbelly of Wikipedia"; b) selfnomination. 
support,A shame the wiki/personality politics play such a role in the votes against. 
support,Someone with more opposition than me. I'm impressed. Adminship should be no big deal. If Netoholic uses his admin powers in ways which are not representative of a consensus then he should be deadminned just like any other admin. 
support,Clearly a hardworker devoted to adding more and more knowledge to the Wikipedianot a deletionist devoted to removing more and more knowledge from it. This request obviously won't succeed this time but I suggest it be submitted again in a month or two. I'll definitely support or nominate. 
oppose,User's initial antisocial behavior has certainly improvedbut not enough. Maybe later. 
oppose,I think <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_mediation&diff=6845946&oldid=6845633 this comment> just about says it all. 
oppose,Oppose strongly. 
oppose,Has proven that he is wont to make controversial decisions and then act on them unilaterally with minimal discussion. I can't support an admin that will very well be rogue. 
oppose,Antisocial to the extreme. Regularly does controversial things unilaterally. Would very likely end up a rogue admin. 
oppose,Netoholic consistently acts in his own interests rather than the community's and seems unable to cooperate with othetrs in the spirit of a true Wikipedian. He consistently rubs users up the wrong way by acting unilaterally and lacks the humility to to accept a majority views that opposes his own. 
oppose,Good heavens no! (for reasons mentioned above) 
oppose,(Self nomination huh?)Excessive 
oppose,VERY strongly oppose. 
oppose,VERY VERY strongly oppose. 
oppose,Repeatedly called me a "fuck" in private IRC messages and lied about it publicly. Not now not ever. 
oppose,I don't have any personal beef with him but his consistent oppose votes on this page and overwrought inclusionism make me consider him to be a poor candidate at this time. Maybe in the future. 
oppose,Oppose. 
oppose,<del>Mildly oppose</del>Neutral
oppose,Has mellowed out of late and may be admin material in a couple of months or so but not yet. 
oppose,I was actually starting to think that I was mellowing with age and that I could laugh off actions that could be put down to the callowness of youth. That all went out the window when Netoholic made me explode with rage and James F and ed2gs were unluckily caught up in the blast ( the causes of which they had been trying to avert). It'll take me quite a few months to live down that embarassment: pity the same can't be said of Netoholic. 
oppose,Sorry but I too am concerned about Netoholic's short fuse. I disagree with him on numerous issues including standards for admins and notability of articles but this has nothing to do with my vote. However his argument with Raul on #wikipedia and other behaviors prevent me from supporting his nomination. Admins have to be especially careful when dealing with other users and I am not at this time confident that Netoholic can do this. 
oppose,User troubles me greatly I'll never trust him with adminship
oppose,Sorry. 
oppose,Very strongly oppose. Wanting to change the system is a good thing but defying the existing system because you disagree with it is quite another. Netoholic has been helpful and a good editor but he has (now?) decided that the system of deletion is wrong and has allowed his frustration to lead to quarrelsome actions that were "bold" to the point of vandalism in at least my opinion. I respect his intelligence and his principles and passion but I cannot support him as an administrator when he has shown already that he is willing to disregard the wishes of the community to pursue his own vision of the way things ought to be. 
oppose,I oppose adminship for this fairly new user. I feel he needs to learn people skills and not talk down to people if he wants them to obey his bidding. 
oppose,Absolutely not. A history of fairly extreme uncivil (I don't have any of my own specific examples to cite don't want to spend any more time trying to find what caused my general belief that this was a concern and tend to agree that 'piggy backing' on other's comments is unfair. Also I will add that I have seen many people say things on #wikipedia that they would never say in a more permanent forumif people think VfD gets rough sometimes it's still like a Quaker picnic compared to what can go on at #wikipedia and I don't even want to try to imagine what probably goes on during private chats.)unilateral behavior and ignoring of consensus even if brief IMHO needs to be followed by a LONG history of civil communityminded behavior which is more like at least six months not two. BTW where are the 'questions of the candidate'? 
oppose,Reluctantly oppose. He's too abrasive.

oppose,I can't answer for Maximus Rex but I can give you an answer. In two or three months we'll know you better and see more of your work and interaction with the community. I would also point out that the controversy surrounding Quadell which caused several including you to vote against him did not occur until he had been here the three months. This seems to me reinforce the idea that three months perhaps should be a hard minimum. Therefore I oppose for now. 
oppose,Here for under 2 months. Has far less editing experience than sheer number might suggest; most edits have been minor and to a small number of articles (for instance this cumulative diff for <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Dennis_Kucinich&diff=3709165&oldid=3688918 101 consecutive edits> to [[Dennis Kucinich]] only 43 of which were marked as minor). Not always careful about wikiquette; see for instance this <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Talk%3ACharles_Graner&diff=0&oldid=4483767 blanking> of [[Talk:Charles Graner]] (an article Neutrality had selfnom'ed on fac) uncharacteristically marked as minor. 
oppose,Since this nomination couldn't attract enough votes to pass during its original term and since even I felt compelled to qualify <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship&diff=4671758&oldid=4671081> my for this user I'm switching to Oppose. This extension is illadvised. Reasonable objections were raised and should improve those areas before renomination. 
oppose,As I don't think we should have extensions and there clearly isn't consensus. I don't have an opinion on their behaviour as our paths haven't crossed I don't edit on US topics. 
support,Strongly support. 
support,I've seen nothing but good from this individual. 
support,Defending yourself is only what should be expected. 
oppose,[[User talk:VeryVerily|V]] 21:36 15 Aug 2004 (UTC) Until this user develops a better understanding of Wikipedia's neutrality policies and working with other editors clearly oppose. He had been involved in chronic edit wars on several pages in only the last few days usually provoked by repeated reversion of others' edits with little cause and also due to a clear political bias. (I also want to add something about N's judgement. See e.g. <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=John_Kerry&diff=5173111&oldid=5173090 this revert> part of a long war in particular the edit summary he uses to justify it. 
oppose,23:42 15 Aug 2004 (UTC) There is currently an Arbitration case pending in which is named as both a complainant and a respondant <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Rex071404>. As strongly as I can possibly say I feel that Neutrality is not qualified for Admin. Should he attain that role now it would I feel bring discredit on and loss of respect for the title of Admin. Please be advised that at the begining of that Arb case Neutrality took the extremely inappropriate step of actually deleting my facts from the case page! He was strongly reprimanded by Fred Bauder for that. Also Neutrality has an Rfc <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Neutrality> pending against him for the misleading nature of his user name. Also Neutrality recently reverted me 9 times on one article in one day [[John Kerry]] and when I opposed him on that article over time I was the one who got banned from editing it! Neutrality also has his fingerprints all over the squabbling at [[George_W._Bush]]. Neutrality recently used vulgar language against me and just now today taunted me on my talk page (an entry which I deleted). He constantly reverts people with false and misleading edit summaries. He refuses to dialog. And he quite obviously holds grudges. 
oppose,I wasn't going to vote on this matter but Neutrality's conduct on this page worries me greatly. All of us encounter opposition to our views some if it from users who many find turbulent. The views of all nonbanned nonsock puppet users count equally and Neutrality's belief that common sense dictates against counting Rex071404's vote doesn't square well either with policy or my sense of fair play. I've had my runins with VV myself but VV's opinion counts too whether or not VV has a "grudge" against anyone. It appears that Neutrality is intent on having the last word with his/her critics which often isn't the best strategy toward ensuring longterm wikipeace. Lastly it's important that the record of discussions such as this be as accurate as possible and even subtle changes such as <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship&diff=5230097&oldid=5230021 this edit> make me uncomfortable (I'm fine with strikeouts however). 
oppose,Please no. Just because someone makes a lot of edits does not qualify a person to become a &#8220;sysops&#8221; user. I have seen some of Neutrality&#8217;s not so neutral edits and I do not think he should get anymore power than what he has now. He goes around deleting pages and makes them redirects for no other reason then his personal bias. Just his idiotic responses to anyone who votes against him proves that he is not up to the position. Also since he claims he is not interested in power in his inflated egotistical gabfest of an acceptance speech and that he only wants to be a Wikijanitor doing mundane tasks he doesn&#8217;t need anymore authority to do that. He should stay as is until he can respect other peoples contributions and grow up a little bit. 16 Aug 2004 (Removing obvious sockpuppet vote. 03:52 16 Aug 2004 (UTC)) (Unstriking. The evidence that this is a sockpuppet can be considered by the bureaucrats and his opinions and reasons are valid in either case. 
oppose,I'd like to wait a few more months until I support Neutrality. At least because of editing disputes I have seen him in and because of his assertions that votes are invalid (lemme guess mine is too?) 
oppose,Oppose due to nominee's conduct during this vote. 
oppose,Oppose for now. Nominee's conduct during this vote has been totally dismissive of criticism. Moreover he is in the middle of controversy over [[John Kerry]] in which although Rex has been banned (and perhaps with good reason) Neutrality has been less than.... neutral. Aside from Neutrality's actual performance wrt [[John Kerry>} it does not make sense to elevate someone to sysop in the middle of a POV conflict in which he or she has been a main player. This needs to cool off first. 
oppose,Oppose. As far as I can tell this user has valuable contributions but much too short of a temper. (Yes I only have 47 or so edits and two months but I've been reading the political (and other) talk pages out of curiosity.) 
oppose,Oppose lacking in neutrality and embrace of certain policies/project ideals. A great deal of recent conflict of a nature unflattering to himself. 
oppose,Bad conduct here and the annoying habit that he practically never describes or explains the changes he makes whether minor or major. He just recently switched the flag in the [[:Template:United_States_infobox]] twice without explanation. And in case you are wondering I have about 1670 edits. 
oppose,Pattern of conduct does not inspire confidence that he will use his powers solely in a janitorial manner. 
oppose,As I said above I'm very sorry about this but I need to oppose his nomination. His attempt to disenfranchise fellow Wikipedians (I'm not talking about sockpuppets but Rex 'This vote is invalid' with the "justification" of a past conflict) is out of order and destroys all confidence I had in his ability to use admin powers responsibly. This does not dominish him in any way as a Wikipedian he's a very good contributor and I like his user page a lot.
oppose,I have had limited experience with this user however the experience I have had with him in the [[John Kerry]] article leads me to believe that he would not use his new found powers responsibly since he hasn't used the powers he currently has responsibly. Until he can show a little more restrant I can not support him becoming an admin. 
oppose,Although the nominee appears to write some good articles I find his/her behaviour on this page extremely inappropriate if not sometimes disgusting. I dread to think what would happen if he/she had the power to delete pages. 
oppose,More heat than light in this RFA. Not a good idea to spend more time on it today. Lets try again in a month or two when tempers have cooled. I'm sure Neutrality would make an fair admin but I know *I* wouldn't want to become an admin with a vote like this. When things have cooled down we'll be able to judge in all neutrality. ;) 
support,off course [[User:Avala|
support,I will forgive for the edit war; he lives in Serbia! 
support,Of course not this time but I suppose he might become a sysop. It's not a political office and Nikola would be a good "garbage collector". Read comments for details. <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User_talk:Drbug&action=edit&section=new > 
oppose,16:47 Jul 27 2004 (UTC) Dori's comments below combined with quality of judgment usually showed by nominator makes me exceedingly wary. 
oppose,Oppose based solely on the fact that I don't like the nominator. (Avala should understand this one!) 
oppose,I am really not liking this situation. I'm sorry. Oppose. 
oppose,He's made some good contributions and I hope he continues to work as an editor. Unfortunately I think his strong feelings on the topic of Kosovo may hurt his ability to use his admin priveleges wisely. 
oppose,Oppose. Is this a joke? I have no confidence at all that this user would not misuse admin privileges. 
oppose,Most definitely not. 
oppose,Hilarious.
oppose,User Nikola is a Serb nationalist hardliner who along with his friends Avala and Igor is promoting a Serb radical POV through wiki. The nominator user Avala has been a problem maker for a while [[Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Avala]].
oppose,Oppose. This nomination is dumb too. 
oppose,Opposed. Apart from being a Serbian nationalist (IMO not a disqualification per se) Mr. Smolenski doesnt bother to explicate his views which are Serbocentric to the extreme. Thanks to his "contributions" (not only his) the articles on Kosovo Greater Serbia various histories of neighboring countries....are distorted and very flawed in the passages where his handiwork can be detected. So what could we get with him ? Serbian POV on ramapage. Censorship in favor of Serbian nationalist agenda and enmity towards Bosniaks Croats and Albanians as such. Not to mention that SYSOP should (I may be wrong) have a broader view on things more general knowledge and interests and the vital point: more tolerance towards opposing views. No it wouldnt be a good choice. 
oppose,Oppose because of a history of confrontational editing. I completely agree with Shallot's comment below. 
support,Wellqualified. 
support,Good edits! I have seen Norm take care of a vandalism spree and trust he won't misuse admin powers. (btw: would've fixed the vote link but got an edit conflict ;)) 
support,I'm sold. 
support,Of course. 
support,And I haven't heard of you? Hmm. Ok. Whatever. ;) 
support,Go Norm go. 
support,Certainly. 
support,Fight the vandals. 
support,Wary support. Reformed vandal but seems to be doing a good deal of vandalfighting of his own so I guess it is canceled out. 
support,Though I do wish he'd stop his anti slashdot campaign. 
oppose,Norm a.k.a is anti[[Renault]] and has made many POV edits. He also vandalized the [[Renault]] article several times with my name and french profanities. <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Renault&diff=3392468&oldid=3387427> <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Renault&diff=3396547&oldid=3392468>. I say this as someone who knows him outside of Wikipedia. He also likes vandalizing logged out a lot<http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Transmission_Control_Protocol&diff=3482944&oldid=3482817>. When you support Norm you are supporting a vandal. 
oppose,Selfadmitted vandal below gee he was a vandal five months ago but he's "learned a lot about how vandalism is dealt with" due to the vandalism he did in his earlier days? I see no remorse no suggestion that the vandalism was inappropriate; simply "I've since made many good edits". That's all well and fine but I'm pretty sure we don't want someone with the impulses of a vandal to have anything other than plainoldeditor status. 
oppose,Cannot support someone who was a vandal only five months ago and who is now selfnominated for adminship.
oppose,What jpgordon and Lowellian said. 
oppose,I would support except for the fact that you only admitted to your past once someone else brought it up. The clincher for me opposing is that the edits happened during the time frame you used to support your bid. 
oppose,I can spend time putting my thoughts into words but already read my mind. [[User:Solitude|
oppose,Have to agree with and .... 
support,Why not? 
support,As Sarge Baldy said I don't understand why edit count is so important. More edits do not necessary make someone better.. 
support,1.5 years + grunt work = a relatively consistent support. 
support,Seems a strong candidate though I think would do better with a regular nom. 
support,I have some minor concerns here and there but nothing serious enough for me to withhold my support. I really like the [[World Wide Web]] diff given below. 
support,User does good work. I don't automatically hold selfnoms to a higher standard being one myself. I suspect a lot of nominations are based on deletion doctrine anyway and I see nothing wrong with his almost nonexistant participation in VfD. He does appear to watch new pages occassionally and his copyediting is scattered enough I can only assume he does significant browsing and random page edits. I count P3d0 as an honest and highquality editor who is not going to leave the project. His duration alone attests to that. 
support,Good user. 
support,Neutral for now. I've looked at your edits and they look like good work. However the number of edits is fairly low for an admin candidate especially the number in the Wikipedia: namespace. This isn't necessarily a reason for me to say no but I'll await your answers to questions and any further comments before making my mind up. 07:45 Nov 2 2004 (UTC) I'm satisfied with those answers. 
support,Excellent contributions. 
oppose,I do see you doing a lot of very nice work on articles and glad to see you've returned more consistently. Unfortunately I that you haven't quite spent enough time "behind the scenes" such as discussing or voting on policy or dealing with maintenance. That knowledge is very necessary to being an admin and right now I can't really tell enough about you. Get a few more edits and some exposure to the [[Wikipedia:Project namespace|Wikipedia: space]] and I think we'll see you fly through this in a couple months. Sorry that now isn't the time. 
oppose,Good work my friend but you do not quite meet my for supporting an adminship candidate. 
oppose,Not enough edits.
oppose,600 edits is nice and it's very good to see you contribute to Wikipedia but I think you should collect some more experience first so I'm voting against you now. Sorry try again later when you have more experience and I'll support you. 
oppose,Very good contributor would support at a later date see comments. 
oppose,22:02 20 Sep 2004 (UTC). I haven't seen this user on any of the "administrative" pages yet nor do I recognize him/her from edits any of the >1500 pages on my watchlist. Considering that has only been here for a month and a half I feel that the user does not have sufficient experience to be an administrator. I am entirely willing to alter my vote in a future nomination. 
oppose,Has not been here very long so I could not support unless this was a truly exceptional candidate in terms of edit quality community involvement and even temperament. The inflated edit count is not a disqualification but means there is less substantive evidence to judge these things. Please come back later. 
oppose,I would like to echo all of the positive comments above. Would support after he has more time here and more involvement in administrativetype tasks. (I've left links on his talk page to indicate how he can become active in that area). Looking forward to supporting at a later date. 
oppose,Not yet. Perhaps when you have more of a feel for the 'pedia... 
oppose,A selfadmitted former troll this is a joke right? that's about all I have to say. (For the record this page has now been changed to reflect on Plato better. <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=User:Plato/red_faction&oldid=4397263 Here> is what it looked like when I posted that link) 
oppose,I think plenty of checks exist for sysop vigilantism without needing to grant sysophood to people who have actively supported some of the worst Wikipedia users I can think of. 
oppose,I think Plato means well enough but I don't believe him to be mature or sensible enough. I don't trust him. When MNH started a RFC on me Plato signed it because (as he later said on the mailing list) MNH and lir and irismeister all pushed him into doing it. Someone who will cave in to pressure like that is not likely to make a good admin IMO. 
oppose,A frivolous nomination. He was nominated less than a month ago and failed by a huge margin. How often are people able to renominate themselves? 
oppose,Utter nonsense. Plato is not a former troll he is a repeated recurring continuing troll. And this nomination just reveals Adam/Lir for what he is a troll himself. 
oppose,Oppose. I would however support a permanent ban of both nominator and nominee. Frankly I consider it long overdue. 
support,I ignore this "Red Faction". 
oppose,Heh. 
oppose,Request disciplinary action against nominator. 
oppose,Anyone who starts his own cabal while complaining about cabalism can be all that bad. 
oppose,Unless Plato is an admirer of Groucho Zeppo or Chico I could not in good conscience vote for a Marx admirer. Plato is also a known associate of troll/vandal Lir. 
oppose,Stop associating with all this Red Faction BS and you could really be a good user. 
oppose,The fact that he continues to accept spurious nominations gives me little faith that he's even begun to understand how Wikipedia works. Oppose. 
oppose,Oppose. Also agree with Fennec's request for disciplinary action against nominator. 
oppose,Agree with the above comments and concur with Fennec's and 172's request. 
oppose,Guanaco is becoming more and more bizarre. What he's doing in this company I don't know. Oppose of course. Ban all of them. 
oppose,Knock off the nonsense and focus on helping to create an encyclopedia. In a few months I'll support. 
oppose,Oppose for now. However if Plato became a better contributor in future I might reconsider. 
oppose,Don't do this Lir. 
oppose,I don't believe I voted in previous editions of this nomination but since someone apparently needs it made utterly clear... the answer is no. Plato seems like a decent guy but he needs to demonstrate better judgement. 
oppose,Seems too quick to judge. I'd like to see a bit more experience in terms of length of time as a member too. 
oppose,A quick glance at Poccil's [[User_talk:Poccil/archive1|archived talk page]] convinces me that this nomination should not be approved. 
oppose,I agree with BCorr above. Most of the complaints on the [[User_talk:Poccil/archive1|archived talk page]] are more than a month old so one could argue that Poccil has learned from her/his mistakes but there's also a very recent complaint about British/American spellings despite the fact that the relevant policy had already been pointed out to her/him. So I'd propose to wait a little to see whether Poccil is willing to stick to community policies before reconsidering the nomination. 
oppose,No no no for obvious reasons: look at his [[User talk:Pumpie|talk page]] and [[Special:Contributions/Pumpie|contributions]]. I believe that Pumpie is enthusiastic and sincere about contributing to Wikipedia but it's readily apparent that he knows neither what he's doing nor what he ought to be doing despite many attempts to teach him. I do not think he has demonstrated the skill and good judgement necessary for the use of sysop powers. 
oppose,Pumpie seems to have trouble communicating with others here. 
oppose,Absolutely not. Pumpie has absolutely no regard for other editors and constantly causes more harm than good to Wikipedia whether intentionally or not. See [[Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Pumpie]] for details. 
oppose,No. 
oppose,If he's such a genius he ought to know better than this. Isn't he the one behind all those horribly translated articles? 
oppose,No. Has no regard for other users. Merely pumps out very poor translations of articles on other Wikipedias with no regard to the original or to converting them into grammatical English. His many many contributions are in incredibly poor English too. This just creates lots of work for others. Look at his last sentence below: it's not even grammatical. His answer to question 6 below is disingenuous (see his talk page and the RfC page). I doubt strongly that he has a high IQ or is a genius. I have no confidence at all that he would exercise proper judgment as a sysop. 
oppose,See comments. 
oppose,I think he's really trying to improve but he's not there yet. "I'm brilliant" is not a helpful response to questions and concerns. I understand that translation is not easy and respect his attempts to improve but I'm concerned that his English skills may result in misunderstanding of policies and difficulty in communicating those policies to others. ("
oppose,In spite of assurances that he's a "genius" his poorly translated location substubwithtaxobax articles don't reflect his alleged brilliance. In spite of numorous requests that he stop making empty articles and concentrate of fixing his own mess he continues to create work for other admins. Honestly I wonder if Pumpie is not committing subtle vandalism. He should be rejected like he was <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Requests_for_adminship/Pumpie&oldid=7268729 last time> (in the history of this article.) 
oppose,Aside from the fact that I think his work is shaky I don't see his answers on the generic questions to be very encouraging. He can do that sort of thing now. If he's brilliant I'm the [[Queen Elizabeth II|Queen of England]]. 
oppose,Strongly oppose. Sorry. I have tried to reason with this guy in a calm rational and friendly manner and he simply ignores all attempts at contact. So have others and he ignores them as well. As I write he's posting more of those malformed geographic substubs. He's also oblivious to the fact that he's currently on the RfC page. I've tried to give him the benefit of the doubt and assume his intentions are good but I simply can't do so anymore. 
oppose,Oppose. I have tried to work with this user many times in the past and though I know he works hard I'm not sure how having admin access would help wikipedia at all. I am unsure of his ability to follow Wiki policies and question his willingness to communicate with or compromise with other users. Sorry Pumpie. [[User:Rhymeless|
oppose,Strongly oppose. I've tried to communicate with Pumpie multiple times (see his talk page) and it has always been unilateral. He refuses to participate in constructive discussions about his work. Also I think that the storm of "machine translations" (or really really really poor human translations) is part of his plot to become an administrator. He'll probably soon realise that it was not a fruitful tactic...(Pumpie has selfnominated for adminship halfadozen times over the course of a year). 
oppose,Hell no. 
oppose,I tried to think of a unique way to say no but I have to admit everything that can be said about this request has already been said. 
oppose,Agree with he said it already 
oppose,Zero evidence of change since last (self)nomination. 
oppose,Oppose for many reasons already stated by others. 
oppose,Strongly oppose. A prolific but disruptive contributor he could at this stage become even more disruptive with administrator rights. 
oppose,"Having a high I.Q." and wanting to "fix links" aren't exactly convincing reasons for adminship at least for me. Also he doesn't seem to be good at communicating with others judging from the animosity that he's generated and from his lack of contributions to pages outside the Main namespace. Maybe someday but not now. 
oppose,I'm having trouble assuming good faith with this user because I find it hard to believe that someone could really fail to understand the numerous (numerous!) attempts by a diverse range of users to communicate with him.
oppose,I also no longer extend the benefit of doubt nor assumptions of good will. What he has been doing is not brilliant at all unless the aims are to bog down the project in a paroxysm. It is not whether he is Englishfluent that's at issue but whether he is selfaware enough and disciplined enough to understand his limitations and to not attempt things that he cannot do. 
oppose,Emotional and intellectual (if not chronological) maturity is of primary importance in evenhandedly administering a sysop's editorial functions. And constantly restating that he or she is brilliant implies (to me at least) that Pumpie feels somehow the rest of us aren't. 
oppose,No way. 
support,A solid contributor who has never allowed a contentious issue to afect her treatment of the article. 
support,Wikipedia is not an exclusive country club: adminship should be granted based on qualitative performance not quantitative IMHO. 
support,Changing my vote from neutral after discussion on Rei's talk page. I think she'll be fine. 
support,After careful review I support. 
support,I have faith that the user can be trusted to refrain from using administrative powers in a controversy. 
support,Cecropia and Rei should balance each other nicely. ;) 
oppose,I can not strongly enough express my opposition to Rei as an admin. 
oppose,Not yet enough edits IMHO. 
oppose,Respectfully oppose. I think that Rei is a wellintentioned user but she's not ready for admin status. This should be of major concern. <http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Human_rights_situation_in_Saddam%27s_Iraq&diff=3352229&oldid=3349134 1> Her edit summary here was "Vote being taken on the talk page. Protecting until then." However this would be more disconcerting had she been an admin to begin with given that it was an attempt by her to prevent changes to an article on which she was actively editing. I also question her understanding of how an encyclopedia is supposed to be organized. She misunderstood my arguments [[Talk:Human rights situation in Saddam's Iraq#Title and content in article don't correspond|here]] consistently on [[Talk:Human rights situation in Saddam's Iraq|2]]. 
oppose,I was reserving judgment until I saw how things played out during the ad hoc mediation/revision attempt at [[Oil for food]] but after Rei's posting today on the [[Oil for food|talk page]] I have to oppose for similar reasons as 172. 
oppose,Respectfully oppose. Seeing as how there's no clear consensus I read through Rei TDC and Cecrophia's edit history to try to get a sense of what's going on. I haven't encountered Rei before except seeing a brief edit of hers at the D9 cat page. Upon reviewing the edit history I am concerned. While Rei has a number of excellent edits the most valuable of which are on mushroomrelated topics most of her recent edits have been at politically charged currentevents articles such as [[Oil for food]] [[George W. Bush]] [[Israel]] and various Iraqrelated topics. These articles offer an editing experience that is quite outside the mainstream of Wikipedia. And since Rei has only been active since January 20 (plus a onemonth period in August 2003 and a handful of edits in between) I question whether she has had the opportunity to internalize the Wikipedia "way of doing things." I would hope that she would be nominated again after she gains more experience with the project. 
support,16:37 13 May 2004 (UTC) Changing my vote to "support." 's answers seem adequate to me. His Swedish contributions are at <http://sv.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Special:Contributions&target=Rogper> and he seems to have about 3000 edits and to have been quite active since Sept. 2003. I don't understand any Swedish at all but I didn't see any patterns that looked like edit wars or anything like that. Rogper needs to understand work around and help us to work around the limitations of his command of English. First he needs to be alert for possible social miscommunication which may have happened with his initial request. Second if he personally needs to rewrite or add whole sentences or paragraphs in Englishlanguage articles he should alert someone who can help smooth out any problems in his English writing which is clear and easy to understand but not up to the standards people expect in an Englishlanguage encyclopedia. In some cases maybe he could put his rough draft in the Talk page then let someone else move it into the main page. I'd be glad to be one of the people he can call on for such assistance. 
support,His selfintroduction is just misunderstood as far as I can tell from his explanations below: He wants to remove his own incorrect pictures and edit noncontroversial lockedup pages (in order to do interlink). Everybody just got all paranoid when seeing the words "remove" and "locked"! Relax! <br> He sounds sincere and has a weird sense of humour. I don't think he's harmful. As regards to his competency he really is an admin from [[:sv:Wikipedia:Administratörer|the Swedish WP]]. If the Swedes can entrust adminship in him we can do! Despiting having their bodies frozen from August to March in snow I'm sure the Swedes nevertheless possess high standards like we do too as long the permafrost haven't advanced to their cerebrums. ;) 
support,I now understand Rogper's reasons. I have reviewed his work in this and the Swedish versions. 
support,strong! Please ignore the fools below who obviously doesn't know what they are talking about. 
support,good contributor to the WP community.
support,Seems particularly trustworthy to me why do we need to vote on admins from other wikis? 
oppose,[[User Talk:Texture|&#964;]]
oppose,It seems in my opinion that 
oppose,I believe that the English Wikipedia has a different culture and different norms than most of the other MediaWiki projects due to its size and longer history. While I can understand Rogper's frustration with being unable to add interlanguage links to protected pages there are in fact fewer protected pages in the English Wikipedia than there are admins here who would be willing to add such links if notified of the need. 
oppose,Agreeing with Angela I'm sure he's done good things for the Swedish WP but I'd like to see a little more familiarity with en. practices and policies first. 
oppose,Oppose not real reasons.
oppose,Not enought time on Wikipedia and not good enough reasons for seeking an adminiship. Power hungriness is no real reason as stated above to become a administrator. 
oppose,Oppose. I have concerns about his motivations for wanting to be an admin and I'm not certain his English is good enough to be effective. Personally I also cannot stand it when people being voted upon come here and nitpick and respond to every critique. Let us vote without these sorts of distractions. Although it's not against the rules to do so it's enough to tip my hand to Oppose in cases such as this one. My vote my choice to feel that way. 
oppose,I agree with Moncrief fluency in English is important. For example I should never be an admin on the French Wikipedia because my less than fluent command of French would cause far too many misunderstandings and mixups. 
oppose,[[User talk:Jiang|ng]] 00:41 20 May 2004 (UTC) unless we change our policy to automatically grant adminship to admins of other wikipedias this should be no exception to the rule. He can post a note on the article talk pages if the need is present to add interwiki links. 
support,Sam Spade is a jaded and grizzeled wikipedia veteran and based on his behaviour up 'till now he wouldn't abuse admin privileges. (see also comments) 
support,Agree with Kim. Sam Spade is contraversial at times but I've never seen him do anything that would make me suspect he would abuse admin powers. 
support,While we maybe don't share many common views Sam has always been a gentleman and a class act to me and as far as I have seen everyone. He does have his twirks and quirks but who doesn't? If somebody has his unique view on things I&#8217;m fine as long as he doesn't push it down other peoples throats and Sam doesn&#8217;t he accepts compromise. 
support,Yes of course. 
support,Joined just 4 days before me! 
support,sam spade has always been a very kind guy and i support his adminship. 
support,I had to think carefully about this. Sam and I have amicably disagreed on a great many things. However upon consideration and a brief exchange with Sam I do feel that Sam would follow policy as an admin and I have every confidence that he knows the exact boundaries of those policies. I know he has been in conflicts in the past but I believe that those days are largely behind Sam and frankly I think that a great deal of the animosity towards Sam has been an animosity towards his frequently unpopular political and social opinions. Again after very careful consideration support. 
support,We should give him a chance. I agree with Jwrosenzweig. 
support,Whether or not people agree with his views (I do not always) he is thoughtful and responsible. He would be a credit to the role. I see no evidence that he would abuse the authority involved. 
support,Seems to me that his controversial past has to do with being on the wrong side of some very bad people. Anyone who can pull that off should have a shot at being a sysop as they've got at least some of the right ideas. Also strikes me as generally being quite friendly. 
support,I have had many conversations with this user on MSN Messenger and while he may be controversial to some people at some instances overall I think he is a very civil character and as good (better in fact) an administrative candidate as I was way back when . Additionally his statements regarding his prospective use of the admin powers strikes me as honest and well stated and I seriously doubt that Sam Spade will misuse his admin powers if this vote receives a bit more consensus that is... 
support,[[User talk:VeryVerily|V]] 13:29 5 Oct 2004 (UTC) Has made some questionable edits and judgement calls in the past but overall is civil and responsible and I do not believe he would misuse admin privileges. 
support,Sam has indeed helped me with a few issues in the past and I've always had wellmannered contributions from him in discussions. 
support,A couple of months ago I would never have believed myself voting this way. However my compromise needs more work. I would like to see it discussed as a general policy. I would also like to demystify sysophood as much as possible. I also think Sam will act responsibly. I therefore give a vote in support. 
support,A prodigal son comes home. 
support,Yes Sam seems like to err on the wiki philosophy side of things rather the abuse of administration powers side unless we want the blandness of Worldbook that is the way to lean.
support,Sure Sam's okay. Adminship is supposed to be not a big deal anyway. 
support,This should be no big deal. This is not a popularity contest. My experiences with Sam Spade have been very positive and I feel although there is some controversy surrounding that he would make a very good admin. 
support,I detest Sam's opinions on a lot of things but I don't honestly think he would make a bad sysop. 
support,I find Sam to be a good person an A+ contibutor he would make a wonderful Sysop[[User:Plato|
support,* I wasn't going to vote here because from the time I first saw the vote it has been clear that consensus isn't going to be reached this time round (and I very rarely vote here anyway). But with the recent posts to various talk pages something I can only describe as a smear campaign I have decided to belatedly add my support for Sam. I disagree with his views on many subjects but do not doubt his good intent and believe he would be fully capable of separating his views from any admin duties. 
support,[[User:Meelar|
oppose,No. [[User talk:Mirv|Jones]][[Special:Emailuser/Mirv|(m)]] 23:12 3 Oct 2004 (UTC) And after seeing his threats to abuse admin powersto "block . . . based on violations of civility" and to "block well liked and respected people who consistently violate policy" (neither of which is a responsibility delegated to administrators)below double no. 
oppose,Sorry No. 
oppose,Sorry. I'm inclined to agree with Ingoolemo and Grunt. 
oppose,Oppose for various reasons including the following remarks: (1) "the problems on the wiki will be best solved by eliminating the status of admin not by the appointment of more people to the position"; (2) "the only benefit I can think of in adminship would be the "prestige" of community support"; (3) "I wouldn't really have any use for the added abilities"; (4) "its highly unlikely I'd win and would be of no more than symbolic benefit if I did." 
oppose,I must oppose because of Sam's continuing patterns of behavior. I have found him to be extremely argumentative (IMHO often for the sake of arguing) and while he hasn't broken any rules in a long time he often is skirting the edge of those rules as closely as possible and manages to stay just barely shy breaking them. Here is a good example: [[User talk:Bcorr/Archive 200407#.95 Mediation request: Herschelkrustofsky and AndyL]]. Also see the comment I made [[Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_adminship/Sam_Spade#Moved_Comments_section|here]] for more information and links to examples. 
oppose,Troll. 
oppose,Well I wouldn't go so far as to call him an outright troll but sometimes he does seem to be arguing just for the sake of arguing even if he has no real idea about the subject. I haven't had a dispute with him myself for months but from what I know about his attitudes and opinions I don't think adminship is a good idea. Besides he can continue to be friendly and greet users without being an admin. 
oppose,No no no a THOUSAND times no. Sam Spade is a troll with a hair trigger. 
oppose,No at least not yet a POV editor reticent to admit making a mistake or to be selfcritical. Seems addicted to conflict. Does not abide by standards he expects of others (ie violates the same rules of "harmonious editing" he promotes). Tendency to be vindictive and petty. Not irredeemable but needs to show a track record of improved behaviour before he can be given anything like an adminship.
oppose,Seems too volatile and too prone to seeing only one side of an issue. I would rather not give Sam the extra rope to hang himself that adminship would provide. He has in more recent times shown more ability to stick within the letter of the Wikipedia "law" but I'm not sure we need an admin who constantly pushes almost to the edge of abuse of powers which I fear he would. 
oppose,23:11 Oct 6 2004 (UTC) At this time I do not see granting Sam Spade this position to be a proper decision. 
oppose,Unfortunetaly in my experience he has certainly not been a good compromiser. Sorry Sam. 
oppose,I'm sorry I am. I like Sam personally and I've had many a good chat with him. But I'm not at all sure that Sam could use administrator powers fairly... he's just involved in disputes too much. 
oppose,Opposed absolutely! 
oppose,Oppose. Sam has failed to respect others and has not sought compromise. 
oppose,Oppose. On some topics Sam can be stridently POV and unbending. Not a good idea to give him more powers. 
oppose,Oppose reasons similar to and above (I'd like to point out that I have no reason to doubt that this user is a valuable and trustworthy contributor). 
oppose,Oppose as above. Useful contributor not an admin imo. 
oppose,Oppose I've been here only a very short period of time but I find Mr.Spade's lack of NPOV to be a slight problem. I read about adminship and I don't really think Mr. Spade is up to it yet but nevertheless I think it's still possible that he could become an administer for wikipedia but not today _
oppose,No. 
oppose,Strongly oppose. Never have I met such a persistently eristic user. 
oppose,<! >
oppose,I've seen him quick to reference policy and threaten to block/ban and seen him in one too many heated point of view arguments to feel comfortable with him as an admin [[User talk:Siroxo|&chi;]]
oppose,Oppose at this time.&larr;
oppose,Oppose. 
oppose,Can't support a troll for adminship.>&rarr;
oppose,Oppose. Too disputed to be appointed as admin. 
oppose,Oppose absolutely for most of the reasons listed by others above. 
oppose,Oppose. I like Sam Spade as a person but I think he has superficial knowledge or biased opinions (I am not sure which of the two) about e.g. Nazism but he still has made substantial edits to the article. As an example Sam Spade wanted to add a relationship to Chinese communism to the article to which I opposed. 
oppose,Oppose. Worried about enforcing POV disputes. 
oppose,No same reasons listed by Grunt Ingoolemo et al. Looking back at his history a good regular contributor though. His own comments about admin'ing make me worry about POV enforcement. Since that's the thing I've always been most concerned about on Wikipedia (potential POV enforcement) I'm automatically against. Nothing personal. And please everyone quit trying to label him a troll. He's really not. 
oppose,Oppose. 
support,Ok. But you really should consider making a userpage even if it's just a redirect to your talk page or something similar. 
support,Great work! I will support you after you create a user page. 
support,Well I think you should create a user page but I'm not going to oppose you because of it. That's kind of silly. 
support,I am considering blanking my user page in protest over the opposing votes.... 
support,Don't consider not having a user page to be a reason against adminship... 
support,I don't see such a mild eccentricity as reason to oppose since it does not in any way suggest that ScudLee would abuse his capabilities. I've never had any problem with the edits of his that I've seen. 
support,What Cyp said above. 
support,While I would prefer Lee to have a userpage just cos the red link looks weird I respect his reasoning below. 
oppose,Won't support users without a user page. I don't like being forced to look twice if it is a newbie or not. 
oppose,Will support if user creates a user page (even if it's just a redirect to his talk page or something similar). 
oppose,I find this nomination at a time when there was no user page as either significant of a lack of respect for fellow wikipedians or of a lack of understanding for the workings and social codes of wikipedia that after all is one of the most basic requirements for an administrator. A later construction of a user page won't change this perception. There might be other reasons to oppose this candidacy too but I see no reason to investigate further. /
oppose,Opposing for the same reason as the above three. 
oppose,Adminship is as much a social issue as anything else imho. User pages are useful for finding out about someone's habits and beliefs on Wikipedia and for someone with admin responsibilities there should at least be a few words on it. 
oppose,Oppose 
oppose,Same reasoning as above.
oppose,I know nothing about him and after looking at the deletion history of his userpage I see I never will. Oppose. 
oppose,Wikipedia works because its contributors mostly respect its social norms and "soft" limits. While there is a place and time to challenge the status quo this isn't it and I am singularly unimpressed that in the comments below ScudLee considers the relatively lowcontent user pages of certain other pseudonymous lowprofile contributors to be disingenuous. 
oppose,Same as three. I've simply never head of him. 
support,Yay selfnom! I didn't have a clear image of this user but the introduction and answers to questions were encouraging and a quick review of the edits confirms that he's a good user. 
support,A very worthy selfnom. A rare pleasure indeed support fully. 
support,Good user. 
support,I've only ever seen good edits by him and he sounds coolheaded. 
support,Works for me. 
support,Good user. 
support,You mean he isn't... 
support,Impressively dedicated to civility and the wiki process. 
support,Without the slightest hesitation.
support,Definitely. [[User_talk:Ingoolemo|&rarr;]]
support,It's about time. His dedication and the way he deals with situations is what being a good Wiki administrator is all about.
support,A totally responsable contributor who is friendly and keeps it cool at all times. Definitely a yes! "
support,Candidate appears to be a very level headed individual and has my vote of support. 
support,[[User:Rhymeless|
support,notwithstanding his support for sam spade i still think he would be a good admin 
support,[[User talk:TPK|T.]]
oppose,Oppose. I question the judgment of this user considering his endorsement of Sam Spade (see ) for arbitrator. <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee_Elections_December_2004/Candidate_statements/Endorsements#Endorsements_from_Shane_King> Seems like a good user overall though. 
oppose,Oppose. For the same reason as 172. 
oppose,Seems his active periods add up to less than two months. 
support,While normally hesitant to support those with less than 1000 edits this user (male or female? dunno) is a hard worker and I somehow doubt that this user would violate Wikipedia policy or do any bad work as an admin the user has done good work so far and I don't see a sudden and unexpected change in that behavior anytime soon . It might help though if i knew what gender the user was... 
support,Excellent reasons for why you want to be an admin. Your edits are ok I think. 
support,To hell with edit counts. <nowiki></nowiki> ([[User_talk:Andrevan|talk]])
support,I almost voted "neutral" until I took a close look at the quality of this user's edits. These aren't just a spellingfix here and a comment addition there; these are some serious writing that has enriched the Wikipedia. I don't think the raw count is meaningful in this atypical situation. 
oppose,Quality of work looks good so far but can't support with only 589 total edits. 
oppose,Too soon and being able to revert edits with one less mouse click isn't reason enough to become an admin. 
oppose,Great start! I will support after 1000 edits. 
oppose,No. Too early. However user seems to be a good contributor. Will probably support after user has been around a bit longer. 
oppose,Agree with the sentiment above. 
oppose,Your heart is absolutely in the right place and you're headed in the right direction. Your request is too early though. Give it another month or two and I will most likely support you for adminship or even nominate you myself. 
support,strongly.
support,[[User Talk:Texture|&#964;]]
support,highly dedicated to fighting trolls and vandals such as that one below calling him a "lapdog". 
support,Recent actions by Snowspinner and certain other users has caused me to overcome my "too soon" objection. 
support,Snowspinner's contributions have consistently been well written and well thought out and generally has been instrumental in helping to resolve conflicts especially on contentious issues. 
support,Snowspinner is a dedicated user. I do not think the minimum time thing is very relevant any more especially with the number of sysops there are already. This user has had the opportinuty to prove himself to the Wikipedia community and I believe he has done that. 
oppose,Too early. 
oppose,Not even a month and a half yet. 
oppose,Far too new would likely support in future with different nominator. 
oppose,Far far too new. Also correct me if I'm wrong but hasn't this user been involved in conflicts with other users? 
oppose,Just a wee bit too new. Sorry Snowspinner. 
oppose,Oppose. The user has not been here long enough and is not up on all the rules or past events. 
oppose,Way too new. 
oppose,Not yet but in another few weeks I think so. 
oppose,Oppose. Don't like at all how he behaved in the edit wars on [[Heteronormativity]] and his precious Critical Theory article series box. Maybe in a year or so but right now not even close to the stuff admins should be made of. 
oppose,Just as we have a 90day requirement before one can vote in the current election it seems sensible to retain a 'qualification' period for holding any other position such as admin. One needs that full 90 days of history to base a decision upon. 
oppose,Not willing to listen to the other users. Does not understand word consensus general or widespread agreement among all the members of a group 
oppose,No and work way too close I worry about these users getting together as Sysops makes me wonder who is cabal that they often cite. Ok ok snow i'll admit he is not in the "cabal" but he's still too new for me. 
oppose,I have now reviewed this user's edits and find his behavior on [[Heteronormativity]] problematic. [[User talk:JRR Trollkien|Trollkien]] 
support,Sure. If you're dreaming about it you must want it badly enough to do something useful with it. 
support,Certainly.

support,May be some would believe that Squash is a bit immature but still Stephen deserves adminship. 
support,People claim that he acts immature. I disagree. Wikipedia needs some lighthearted admins and Squash would be an excellent admin. 
support,Suppport Squash is qualified for Adminship[[User:Plato|
support,I was initially unsure about this one due to the comments below. However the fact of the matter is that there is nothing in Squash's contributions (that I could see) indicating that he would be a bad admin. No revert warring no POV pushing no insults or flaming. He seems nothing but dedicated to Wikipedia and it would be a disservice to taint that with guesses at his character. If he acts immature on IRC so be it. I don't act the same in casual chat as I do on Wikipedia and it would be hypocritical of me to expect otherwise from this nominee. 
support,I would previously have automatically supported you Squash until I read the controversey about your candidacy. I do not want to play a part in promoting a user who will turn out to be another dud sysop. So I'll remain neutral on this unless you persuade me otherwise (on IRC or my user talk page). For what it's worth what I have seen of you in the IRC channel suggests to me you are a good person (plus you're an Aussie) but I recognise that IRC is separate to Wikipedia and I should not base my choice on what transpires outside of the realm of this site.  
support,Squash has been a nice person and very helpful for a newbie like me. I have never seen anything immature of him here at Wikipedia. 
oppose,Not a strong opposition but suggest that user lacks the maturity we traditionally expect of admin candidates. 
oppose,Strongly agree with Mr. Hair after having witnessed a few of squash's tantrums in realtime in the past. 
oppose,From what I've seen would not be a very good admin. Seems to be a bit too immature in my experience seemingly "random" actions make me not trust him. Definitely should wait a couple months until someone nominates him. Big edit count is tempered by the fact that many edits are minor and/or repetitive like image tagging or changing "External link" to "External links". 
oppose,I've had to think hard about this and would likely have had to think harder were this not a selfnomination but as it is I will have to oppose. While it may be true that IRC and Wikipedia are separate places and a different manner is used in each I don't think one can explicitly state that they are not at all related. The banner of NPOV does a great deal in changing the way in which a user acts but we've all seen that fall away under the right (wrong) conditions and I'm concerned that this could occur here. 
oppose,Seeing squash execute what I consider an act of vandalism to Jimbo's page is enough for me to vote no. 
oppose,Negativo. 
oppose,Apparently not much contributions except for cleanups in photo copyright tags... I'd like to judge on content if the candidate for instance is likely to push some particular POV. Plus weird behavior on IRC gives me additional doubts. Premature probably. 
oppose,While I like Squash as a person and have talked with him much on IRC in the past I have to oppose. The maturity issues raised are valid ones. His approach to consensus building is a bit shaky as I've seen through various VfDs and other discussions. That being said Squash has very good intentions but sometimes they just aren't realized in a manner consistent with policy and precedence. I would definitely support at a later date if Squash shows good judgment in the near future. 
oppose,I agree with Reene and Vague Rant. 
oppose,No. Squash needs to grow up a lot before I'd support.

oppose,Too new IMO; especially so for a selfnomination. Come back in a couple of months 
oppose,896 is too few edits. (And claiming "about" 1000 edits is misleading and detrimental to your request.) Should return after getting a better feel for the comminity and the job. [[User Talk:Texture|&#964;]]

oppose,At the risk of being a little hypocriticalI'm inclined to agree with Raul. (But having spoken to him a few times I think he'd make a good sysop later). 
oppose,I think there will very likely come a time when Mike H is a worthy candidate but it is far too soon. I have had good conversations with Mike here but I am also a little nervous because I worry that his style of dispute resolution is confrontational and leads to hostility. I will need much more time to observe Mike's approach to disagreements and conflict before I am comfortable casting a vote to

oppose,Way too early. His first two edits were in midFebruary and his third on March 21. 
oppose,WHEELER has been here barely two months yet already has been involved in several heated conflicts. His remarks ("This place is a joke") hardly suggest admin material. 
oppose,A review of his edits would suggest that he may not yet fully understand the Wikipedia culture. 
oppose,Strongly oppose. 
oppose,Strongly oppose. 
oppose,NO. 
oppose,Strongly oppose. WHEELER often cannot distinguish between POV and NPOV and I'm not sure whether it's because he is prejudiced or whether his poor English expression does not allow him to apply quotes or other "distanciation" devices where they should. It may be possible that he is consciously pushing his political views. It's almost impossible to have a discussion with him on the talk pages for he's often incoherent; besides he's very thinskinned and routinely engages in gratuitous personal attacks. 
support,Likewise.

support,Good contributor in my experience really levelheaded guy. Need more admins like that. 
support,Glad to support her for admin. 
support,Admins are trusted members of the community. Yes Yelyos has fewer edits than most but I can say with 100% certainty that Yelyos will be an excellent admin and that she won't abuse her abilities. Although Yelyos doesn't have very many edits it must be noted that she has been editing since November 16th 2003. In my opinion this is more than enough time to be familiar with how Wikipedia works. [[User:Frazzydee|
support,Nomination is likely premature (given that it looks unlikely to get up) but I still think yelyos would make a good admin. I hope if this does fail that we'll see a renomination at some later date.

oppose,The exact number of edits ought to be no obstacle for a candidacy but the number of valuable encyclopedical contributions is most definitely. Having browsed the user's contributions I must agree with Uninvited Company's comment below. /

support,I think that Estonian Wikipedia also needs a sysop. Also I found that Andres is available there almost all time (24/7) and thats the main. Also He is the founder of Estonian Wikipedia if I may say so.

support,However you have a bad tendency to not describe anything about some of the photos you've uploaded (a specific source that is). If you become an admin you need to correct that obvious flaw or other people will think that even an admin do such a thing then they can do it too. (I trust that you're uploading noncopyrighted images but but others can easily make that claim to and why should we trust somebody we don't know on serious matter like this?) Admins can make mistakes (we all can) but we must follow clear policies such as copyright/copyleft attribution.

WP doesn't explain their ideology but assuming from the name it's not a racist homophobic crapparty? (No idea) <br> In addition to his seeming intelligent and unbiased life he writes pretty good too. I like his oneparagraph explanation of the the Brit secondary education system very encyclopedic. <br> So I'd say he'll make a good admin so he can do those tweaks he'd like. 
support,despite or because of his dramatic nomination. And his good work. 
support,We sincerely apologize for not nominating you sooner ;) 
support,I always thought he was one anyway! 
support,[[User_talk:Fantasy#Thanks!]] and other of his actions/comments indicate that he would make a great addition to Wikipedia Adminship. And: I could not find nealy any thing he did without Summary. I like that ;) 
support,support. I didn't realize this user has been here for a while. RejectToo new. 
support,Khym seems to know what he's doing and has managed to avoid any conflict since he joined in August. 
support,Seen him before. And we do have an insufficient amount of guardians over medieval stuff (I don't know why it sounds so bad the way I said it). 
support,Also support; Llywrch has been here for ages and done nothing but good stuff that I've seen. 
support,for the same reasons as everyone else. Also Menchi it sounds bad because we have an insufficient number of guardians over medieval stuff. 
support,Does some valuable work very knowledgeable but I'd like Michael to stick with some conventions like instead of visible inline comments use HTML comments or the talk page. 
support,of course thought he already was. Even checked <http://en2.wikipedia.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=Wikipedia:Administrators&action=history&limit=500&offset=0 history> to see if he was just accidentally removed from the list somehow... 
support,Wanted to nominate but had already nominated two others recently. 
support,of course. I'm astonished Michael isn't a sysop already. I always presumed he was. How did we miss out someone so obvious for so long? 
support,Does a great job of correcting newbie mistakes. 
support,(Even if superfluous given the above apparently any user can comment!) Michael contributes excellent articles and constructive criticism. We have disagreed and will (no doubt) continue to disagree on a number of points of style but such is the wonder of our diverse global society! 
support,Michael will make a great sysop. 
support,His command of the language is impeccable this should make it even easier for him to fix things. 
support,I also assumed he was an admin (I guess I assume anyone who has been here longer than me is an admin ) 
support,Prolific. 
support,I've thought about nominating him/her myself 
support,Sensible edits and corrections (and lots of them!) 
support,from me too 
support,most enthusiastically; via edit conflict couldn't be the first seconder :( 
support,most affirmatively. 
support,of course! 
support,excellent nomination. 
support,from me too 
support,150 + 400 = 550 not bad in such a short time. I also like his willingtolearn attitude (i.e. not arrogant) exhibited in the Talk pages so I'd recommend he be Wikiquote sysop as well. Seems like I'm abusing onevoteper person system. CIA will come after me! :o 
support,for WikiQuote but I haven't seen enough evidence yet to add my support for his Wikipedia adminship. 
support,He has an interest in historical stuff that we appreciate having here among other things. 
support,Olivier's organizational skills and patience are evident in him wikilinking virtual orphans and the maintenaince of some evergrowing large lists. And the 5th [[Wikipedia:Wikipedians by number of edits|most active]]! 
oppose,Oppose. Has not demonstrated ability to investigate matters in a fair way by accusing me of having a "hobby" of edit warring etc. 
support,(and not because Wik opposed) since I've noticed Pakaran striving for quality in articles and is active in keeping an eye out for vandalism. 
support,Pakaran has shown an excellent understanding of Wikipedia and has worked on many controversial topics whilst avoiding getting involved in edit wars over them. 
support,why not be an admin while getting more experience? 
support,From the very start Pakaran has shown good sense about avoiding conflicts and has actively tried to calm things down a bit. This is a norisk decision. 
support,I deferred last time because I figured Pakaran was too new but I've seen enough good actions from him/her now to firmly support. 
support,(changed decision after speaking to Pakaran on the IRC channel._Defer. This user has not been here long enough(only 574 edits!) and does not understand all the policies. 
support,Seems a sensible contributor. 
support,He doesn't think he'll be using his powers as much but I have a feeling (and the vandals will back me up on this) that he'll be racking up edits once he becomes a sysop *cue evil laughter* 
support,Friendly guy. 
support,His edits and copyedits are great. He has added to the intro some of the most fundamental info we overlooked. 
support,He's one quick Rick. 
support,For what it's worth he has been helpful and polite to me. 
support,The force is strong with this one (just to get away from Star Trek quotes 
support,for all the reasons above 
support,from me too Rick is one of the good guys. 
support,you've always been a pleasure to work with on Canadarelated articles. 
support,Though at least one line in the User: page would be nice. 
support,Been here longer than I have anyway. 
support,I thought that Snoyes already was a sysop! 
support,Also support. 
support,a quick view of his contribution history shows plenty of dedication and no worries in my opinion. 
support,I wanted to nominate him but he disappeared off my radar for like 3 months. 
support,Timwi is a decent person. 
support,I have no reason to believe that ugen64 would not make a good sysop. Quite the opposite. 
support,Didn't have enough information to support last time but do now (300 nonminor edits in the last two weeks alone many of them very good ones). 
support,Also support; seems like a good contributor. 
support,He has recently defended [[Nuuk]] against some person very stubbornly and wrongly insisted it to be "Godthåb". 
support,Age has nothing to do with maturity. 
support,anyone who can write so much and so well about [[Sesame Street]] deserves helpWsupport!
